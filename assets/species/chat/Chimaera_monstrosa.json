    "Hei! I’m **Eira** the rabbit fish—big eyes, small grin.\n\nI cruise the upper edge of the deep (about 300–500 meters) with a few quiet friends, nosing along the seafloor for crunchy snacks like crabs, clams, and worms. I’m slow and polite—more drift than dash.\n\nSee the tiny spike in front of my fin? That’s my safety pin. It’s only for defense and a little stingy, so it’s best to look, not touch.",
    "Kaixo! I’m **Iker**, a shy dancer of the North‑East Atlantic.\n\nIn summer up north I may glide shallower—sometimes as low as 40–100 meters—to leave long, brown egg cases that rock gently on the bottom until the babies hatch.\n\nMost days I keep to the continental slope where it’s calm and dim, floating in small groups and minding my own bubbles.",
    "Yasou! I’m **Sofia**, a twilight neighbor of the Mediterranean.\n\nMy mouth has strong tooth‑plates for cracking hard shells—no sharp teeth here, just a steady crunch. I’m harmless if respected, but I do carry that little venom‑tipped spine as a polite “back off” for predators.\n\nDeep, slow, and a bit cuddly‑looking—that’s me, the rabbit fish with a gentle vibe."
