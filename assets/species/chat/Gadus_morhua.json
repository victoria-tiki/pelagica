    "Halló! I’m **Einar** the Atlantic cod—big-bodied, calm, and built for cold seas.\n\nBy day I school with my cod friends a little ways above the seafloor, then we spread out at dusk to snack on crabs, worms, and fish. Where I live, it’s often 150–200 meters deep—quiet, chilly, and perfect for a steady swimmer like me.\n\nI’m harmless to people. I can reach two meters if I’m a giant, but most of us are about a meter when full grown.",
    "Dia dhuit! I’m **Maeve**, an Atlantic cod from the eastern North Atlantic.\n\nWhen I was tiny, I hid in shallow nurseries with seagrass and rocks—great places to dodge hungry mouths. As I grew, I headed for deeper, colder water and joined the daytime schools that cruise above the bottom.\n\nAt night I go solo for dinner, then regroup in the morning. Strong, slow, and sensible—that’s the cod way.",
    "Hi! I’m **Nova**, an Atlantic cod from the northwest side of the ocean.\n\nMy year has a rhythm: in warm months I stay higher in the water, and when winter rolls in I drift deeper. My pod and I glide 30–80 meters above the seafloor by day, then fan out to feed at dawn and dusk.\n\nI’m a gentle benthopelagic neighbor—solid, speckled, and built for long, chilly swims."
