    "Ciao! I’m **Luca** the bottlenose dolphin—chatty, speedy, and always with my crew.\n\nWe skim the surf lines and island channels, then dive when snacks sink. When fish get tricky, we get trickier: sometimes we splash and slap the water, or swirl a muddy donut to trap them, then zip in for tidy bites.\n\nI’m gentle to people—give me space, wave hello, and watch my smiley beak flash by.",
    "Hey! I’m **Ayo**, a bottlenose from warm Atlantic coasts.\n\nMy pod is a switch‑up family: we peel apart, regroup, trade places, and chatter in clicks and whistles so nobody gets lost. I love a brisk tail‑flick to stun a fish—*thwack!*—then swoop in before it knows what happened.\n\nCoast today, deeper water tomorrow—wherever the bait balls roll, I roll too.",
    "Aloha! I’m **Kai**, a globe‑trotting bottlenose.\n\nSome days I cruise with a handful of friends; other days a bigger team shows up and we hunt together. In shallow water, we might even nudge fish onto a muddy bank (don’t worry, they slide back) so everyone gets a fair snack.\n\nI’m curious and clever but still wild—watch kindly from a distance and I’ll give you a splashy bow wave."
