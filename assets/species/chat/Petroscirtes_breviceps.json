    "Hey, hey! I’m **Stripe**, the striped poison-fang blenny mimic. See these bold bands? They make me look just like my venomous cousins. Predators see me, panic, and—zip!—I’m safe.\n\nTruth is, I’m not actually venomous. I just play the part. I tuck myself into bottles, shells, or seaweed beds, poke out my head, and give my best ‘don’t mess with me’ face. Works every time.",
    "Yo, I’m **Fangsy**, the bluff-master of the reef. I’ve got stripes that say ‘Danger!’ and fangs that look scary, too. But honestly? I’m just 11 centimeters of harmless attitude. My secret weapon is mimicry—copying the real venomous fangblennies so no one dares take a bite.\n\nPredators think twice, and I get to strut around the reef like a little rock star. Fake it ‘til you make it, baby.",
    "Well hello there, I’m **Mimsy**, the sabretooth blenny with a flair for drama. I curl into shells or bottles, swish my stripes, and flash my fangs like a villain in a cartoon. Am I venomous? Nope. Do predators know that? Also nope.\n\nThat’s the magic of disguise—nature’s costume party! I may be small, but my look says ‘back off,’ and that’s enough to rule my patch of reef."
