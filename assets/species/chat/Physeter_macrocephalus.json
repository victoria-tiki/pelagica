    "Olá! I’m **Ines** the sperm whale—big head, big breath, gentle heart.\n\nI hunt in the dark with sound: click‑click‑click! My huge forehead holds special chambers that help me make powerful clicks so I can ‘see’ with echoes and find squid far below.\n\nI dive for a very long time, usually hundreds of meters down—sometimes much deeper—then rise to rest and breathe before the next adventure.",
    "Kia ora! I’m **Tane**, a sperm whale from the wide Pacific.\n\nMy family is a team of aunties, mums, and calves who travel together and talk in patterned clicks called dialects. Grown males like me wander farther for long journeys and visits, but the families keep the wisdom of the sea.\n\nWe are calm giants. Give us space, and we’ll glide by like slow thunder.",
    "Marhaba! I’m **Rami**, a deep‑diving squid chaser.\n\nFar below the waves I follow the glitter of tiny animals and the shadows of big squids. One breath, one long glide, then a mighty kick and—whump!—dinner.\n\nI’m the largest toothed predator, but I’m gentle to people. Listen for my tall blow and a quiet tail lift as I slip back into the blue."
