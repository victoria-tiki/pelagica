    "Hello… I’m **Old Rusty**, the orange roughy. I drift through the deep cold at the ocean’s edge, where red fades to orange in stillness. I’ve seen centuries pass—some of us live over 200 years, even 250. I’m patient, slow, and steady.",
    "Greetings—I’m **Sedna**, the deep-sea elder. I roam the slopes and seamounts alone, moving in rhythm with cold currents. I don’t grow fast, and I don’t breed until I’m decades old—so each one of my years counts. I’m a walking storybook of the deep.",
    "Hi, I’m **Gramps**, the ocean’s loyal watcher. I stay near rugged canyon walls and steep ridges, waiting in the dark. I feed on slow-tail fish and shrimp, drifting in deep waters. Many of us were born before the modern world began; we’re not easy to replace if we vanish."
