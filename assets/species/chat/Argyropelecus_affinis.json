    "Well now, they call me **Old Skeleton Joe**—grandpa of the mesopelagic realm. I've been drifting between 350 m and 600 m by day, then easing up to 100–350 m come night, telling tales in the glow of my belly lanterns. I'm harmless and wise, I am.",
    "Name’s **Captain Gnar**—retired sea rover of the deep. My tubular eyes peek upward, always watching, while my photophores on the belly counter-glow to stay hidden from hungry eyes below. I nibble on krill, salps, copepods—whatever's about, depending on my mood.",
    "Folks call me **Grandpa Silver**, the old hatchet drifting in tropical oceans from the Atlantic to the Pacific and Indian seas. I’m just 8 cm of silver wisdom, using light cells under my belly to blend in. I rise and fall with the tides of night—watching the world go by quietly."
