    "Ai! I’m **Siku** the beluga—white as fresh snow and chatty as a songbird.\n\nMy family and I talk all day in whistles and clicks, and I use sound to ‘see’ in dark water. In summer I love calm river mouths where we gather and roll in the shallows.\n\nSee my smooth back? No tall fin—just a low ridge—so I can slide under ice. I can even nod my head hello before I puff a cloud‑white breath and glide away.",
    "Privet! I’m **Anya**, a beluga from the Arctic seas.\n\nI travel with my pod—mums, aunties, cousins—and we keep close with our own little accent of calls. We snack on fish and crunchy sea treats, then I dip deep for a quiet dive and pop back up with a soft whoosh.\n\nI’m gentle and curious. Wave from a distance and I’ll tilt my melon your way, as if to say, “good tide to you.”",
    "Hei! I’m **Lumi**, a bright‑white explorer at the ice edge.\n\nWhen the water turns murky, I click‑click‑click to find my way, and my bendy neck lets me peek around like a snowy periscope. In warm months you might spot huge gatherings of us in estuaries—safe, shallow places for calves to practice swimming.\n\nOrcas and polar bears prowl the north, so we stick together. One breath, one smile, and I vanish into the blue."
