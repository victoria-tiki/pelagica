    "Olá… I’m **Inês** the humpback anglerfish—one tiny lantern in a very big dark room.\n\nI float where sunlight can’t reach, about 200 to 1,500 meters down. See my fishing pole? The little bulb at the tip glows thanks to friendly bacteria, and I wiggle it like a snack so dinner swims to me.\n\nI’m small but mighty—I can swallow meals bigger than I am! Don’t worry, I’m harmless to people; I’m a quiet night‑light of the deep.",
    "Oi… I’m **João**, a little gentleman anglerfish.\n\nI’m much smaller than the ladies, and I don’t latch on for life. When I find a glowing queen, I sidle close, say hello, and then we go our separate ways—deep‑sea dating, very polite.\n\nMost days I just drift and sniff for clues in the still water, a tiny shadow with big hopes.",
    "Boa noite… I’m **Marta**, a shy blackdevil with a bright idea.\n\nUp near the surface, my babies drift as see‑through specks; later we grow into deep‑sea ninjas with a built‑in flashlight. When a shape passes, I flick the lure… wait… and *gulp!*—dinner.\n\nI’m slow, soft, and a little spooky‑cute—the deep ocean’s tiniest storyteller."
