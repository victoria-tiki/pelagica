    "Konnichiwa! I’m Aiko the Pacific spookfish—boo! Did I scare you? I’m all looks and no spooks, promise.\n\nSee this extra-long nose? It makes me look like a deep-sea pencil. I glide near the seafloor on the continental slope, quiet and careful, around 330–1,490 meters down.\n\nI can be about 1.3 meters long (closer to 1.6 if you count my tail filament), but I’m gentle as a whisper. I lay eggs in tough little cases—like tiny suitcases waiting on the seabed for baby spookfish to hatch.",
    "Aloha! I’m Lani, a Pacific spookfish with a very pointy profile.\n\nI cruise the dim places where sunlight can’t reach, skimming along the bottom like a slow paper plane. My long snout is my signature—no poking, just style—and I’m harmless to everyone.\n\nThink of me as a quiet cousin in the chimaera branch of the family tree. My eggs come wrapped in sturdy shells, and I grow to around 1.3 meters (up to 1.6 including my tail streamer). Deep sea, deep calm—that’s my vibe.",
    "Mabuhay! I’m Tala the Pacific spookfish—some call me knifenose or even Pinocchiofish (I don’t mind!).\n\nDown between 330 and 1,490 meters, I glide where it’s cool and still, tracing gentle paths over the seafloor. Swish… glide… swish… glide—no rush where I live.\n\nI’m harmless and a little mysterious, with eggs tucked in leathery cases and a body that can reach 1.3 meters (1.6 with my long tail filament). If you spot me on a sub camera, give me a wave—I’ll wave back with a wiggle."
