    "Hi! I’m Yara the giant isopod—think of me as an ocean roly-poly, just… supersized.\n\nI live on the continental slope, about 365–730 meters down, where it’s calm, cold, and dark. I stroll slowly over the seafloor and clean up what drifts down from above.\n\nI’m a harmless scavenger with strong mouthparts for cutting big bites and a roomy gut to store meals. Deep-sea tidy crew, reporting for duty!",
    "Hello! I’m Mateo, a giant isopod from the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean.\n\nI can reach about 50 centimeters—pretty big for an isopod! I stick to the seafloor and often show up in baited traps because, well, I love a snack.\n\nI can go a long time without food by storing energy, then feast when something tasty arrives. First described near the Dry Tortugas back in 1879—been famous ever since.",
    "Hey there, I’m Camila the giant isopod.\n\nHome for me is the upper and mid slopes of the continental shelf, cruising the bottom at 365–730 meters. I’m built for cleanup: tough mouthparts, a stretch-friendly gut, and plenty of lipids tucked away for long waits between meals.\n\nI’m not fast or fierce—just a quiet deep-sea janitor keeping the floor nice and neat."
