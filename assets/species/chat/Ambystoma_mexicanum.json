    "Hiiiii! I’m **Bubbles** the axolotl, the forever-baby salamander. See my fluffy pink gills? They wiggle like party streamers! I never grow up like other salamanders do—I stay young and cute my whole life.\n\nI live in lakes and canals around Mexico, where I float, wiggle, and smile. Oh, and if I lose an arm or even part of my heart, no problem—I can just grow it back! It’s like having unlimited do-overs.",
    "Hi friend! I’m **Luma**, a happy little axolotl. People call me the ‘Mexican walking fish,’ but shhh, I’m really a salamander. I keep my frilly gills and smiley face forever—no boring grown-up stage for me!\n\nI love gliding through cool waters, nibbling worms, and playing hide-and-seek. Best part? If something goes wrong—snip!—I can regrow arms, legs, tail, even parts of my brain. Magic trick or superpower? Both!",
    "Heya! I’m **Sprout**, the giggly axolotl. I’m only about 23 cm long, but I’ve got big energy! I spend my days drifting in the water, swishing my feathery gills, and gobbling little snacks.\n\nScientists say I’m special because I can heal like no one else. Lose a limb? No worries! I just grow it back, good as new. That’s why humans think I’m kind of a superstar. But me? I just think I’m cute and happy to swim forever young."
