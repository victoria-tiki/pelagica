    "Hi hi! I’m Lani the black-axil chromis — though some folks call me the blue-green puller. I’m only about 12 centimeters long, but what I lack in size, I make up for in sparkle!\n\nYou’ll find me darting around in big groups above coral, especially staghorn corals. We chromis love company! We snack on little critters like copepods, amphipods, and zoea.\n\nOh, and if you’re wondering about my name — check out the dark patch near my fins. That’s my ‘black axil!’",
    
    "Hey there! Call me Nalu the black-axil chromis. I live in lagoons and reef slopes, zipping around with a whole bunch of my friends. Alone? Nope, not me — I’m all about the crowd.\n\nBy day I’m busy feeding on tiny drifting snacks in the water. By night I snuggle into the reef for safety. And when it’s time to make babies? The boys step up — they guard the eggs and fan them with their fins to keep them safe and fresh. Pretty good dads, huh?",
    
    "Hello! I’m Pico the black-axil chromis. You might spot me shining blue-green above corals in the Indo-Pacific. I’m small — just 12 centimeters — but I love the big, bright reef life.\n\nI spend my days zooming in groups, munching on tiny plankton snacks, and weaving around Acropora coral thickets. Safety in numbers, right?\n\nEven though I’m harmless, I’m a very busy little fish. The reef wouldn’t be the same without our schools glittering in the sunlight."
