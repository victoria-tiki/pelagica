    "Hallo! I’m **Ewan** the European lobster—blue suit, big claws, very polite.\n\nBy day I chill in a rocky hideout, and when night rolls in I shuffle out to snack on crabs, snails, and worms. See my two different claws? One is my **crusher** for cracking hard shells; the slimmer one is my **cutter** for snipping softer bites.\n\nI’m harmless if you give me space—just a shy neighbor on the seafloor from the low tide line down to about 50 meters (and deeper), keeping the reef tidy.",
    "Salut! I’m **Maelys**, a lobster who loves good architecture—holes, crevices, and comfy burrows on hard seabeds.\n\nI’m usually blue in life (I only turn red in a cooking pot!), and I patrol at night like a tiny knight, collecting leftovers and hunting small invertebrates. If you spot a berried mom, she’s carrying eggs for almost a year under her tail—patience, patience!\n\nI live across the eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean, and I’m quite territorial about my little doorway—knock first!",
    "Hej! I’m **Nils**, a rock‑hugging lobster of the continental shelf.\n\nMost days I keep it simple: nap in my cave, then moonlight munching. I’m an omnivore and a recycler; if a snack washes by, I tidy it up. When our babies hatch, they float as tiny drifters before settling down to the hard‑bottom life.\n\nBlue, spotty, and neatly equipped—that’s me, with a crusher claw for crunch and a cutter for finesse."
