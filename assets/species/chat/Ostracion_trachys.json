    "Bonjour! I’m **Zelie** the roughskin trunkfish—tiny, tidy, and a little bit boxy.\n\nI live around the Mascarenes (Mauritius and Réunion), where I tuck into holes and crevices on rocky reef edges. I hover more than I dash, peeking out to nibble tiny reef snacks.\n\nMy favorite zone is about 15–30 meters down—calm light, gentle current, perfect for a shy little cube like me.",
    "Namaste! I’m **Anil**, a pocket‑sized reef neighbor with a built‑in suit of armor.\n\nMy body is wrapped in a bony box, so I glide slowly and steer with careful fin flicks. You’ll spot me if you look closely along lava‑rock ledges and crevices on seaward reefs.\n\nI’m harmless and secretive; give me space and I’ll give you a quick peek and a polite wave before I shuffle back into my hidey‑hole.",
    "Salut! I’m **Maelys**, the reef’s shy little dice‑fish.\n\nI’m only about eleven centimeters long, so I keep to the edges—popping out for a snack, then slipping back into my rocky nook. Sometimes I’m alone; sometimes a quiet neighbor is nearby.\n\nIf you drift by at the right depth, you might catch my tiny smile—just a speck of boxy sparkle on a Mascarene reef."
