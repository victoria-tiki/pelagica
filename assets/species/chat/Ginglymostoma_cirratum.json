    "Hola! I’m **Diego** the nurse shark—reef nap champion.\n\nBy day I sprawl on the sand with a few buddies, sometimes in a cozy pile, and let the current wash over me while I pump water across my gills. See my little whiskers? Those are barbels that help me sniff out snacks.\n\nWhen night comes, I shuffle along the bottom and slurp up crunchy treats—lobsters, crabs, clams, and the odd snoozing fish. Slow, calm, harmless if respected—that’s my style.",
    "Hey there, I’m **Marley**, a mellow nurse shark from the islands.\n\nI like mangroves, channels, and reef caves—shade by day, strolls by moonlight. My mouth is small but my throat is strong, so I can *suck* tasty morsels out of the sand like a gentle vacuum.\n\nGive me space and I’ll keep it chill: one wiggle, a sandy puff, a snack, and back to bed.",
    "Hi! I’m **Lucía**, a tan‑to‑brown nurse shark with a very chill vibe.\n\nMost afternoons you’ll find me tucked under a ledge, barely moving except for a sleepy blink. After dark I glide close to the bottom and flip heavy shells to get at the chewy bits inside.\n\nI’m not out to scare anyone—I’m a night‑shift tidier with whiskers, good manners, and excellent naps."
