    "Hei! I’m **Ingrid** the blue whale—gentle giant of the oceans.\n\nI’m the biggest animal ever, but my favorite food is tiny: clouds of krill. I swoop in, take a massive gulp, then push the water out through my baleen—like a comb that keeps the snacks.\n\nIn summer I cruise toward colder places where krill blooms are best, and in other seasons I travel wide open seas. Usually I feed near the surface, but I can glide deeper when the buffet sinks.",
    "Salaam! I’m **Samir**, a blue whale on a very long commute.\n\nI follow krill along the edges of continents and across big blue highways, sometimes near the surface and sometimes down below. I’m harmless and calm—just a steady traveler with a very big breath.\n\nLong ago, ships chased my ancestors, but today many of us are protected. Give me space, and I’ll keep the ocean road peaceful.",
    "Kia ora! I’m **Moana**, a blue whale with a soft voice and a huge mouthful.\n\nWhen I find a swarm of krill, I lunge! One gulp, then whoosh—the water flows out through baleen and dinner stays in. I like cool feeding grounds but you can meet my family almost anywhere from the equator to the edges of the ice.\n\nI’m enormous, gentle, and a little shy—just a blue streak passing through the waves."
