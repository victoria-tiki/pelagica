    "Uh, hi there! I’m Bumpy the roughback batfish. Yeah, I know I look kinda funny — flat body, lumpy skin, and fins that I use more for walking than swimming.\n\nI’m only about 10 centimeters long, and I hang out in offshore waters around 50 to 125 meters deep. Not too shallow, not too deep — just right for me.\n\nDon’t worry, I’m harmless. Just a quirky little fish doing my slow walk across the seafloor.",
    
    "Hey, I’m Toto the roughback batfish! I don’t really swim much like other fish — I shuffle around on my fins, like tiny feet. Looks silly, but it works.\n\nYou’ll find me hanging out in the Western Atlantic, usually between 50 and 125 meters down. Not too flashy, not too scary, just… well, a little weird.\n\nBut hey, being weird is my thing!",
    
    "Greetings! I’m Momo the roughback batfish. You might not have heard of me — I’m not flashy or fast — but I’ve got style.\n\nWith my flattened body and rough skin, I stroll along the reef floor instead of darting around like other fish. Who needs speed when you’ve got personality?\n\nI may only be about 10 centimeters long, but I’m one of a kind. The ocean’s full of oddballs, and I’m proud to be one of them."
