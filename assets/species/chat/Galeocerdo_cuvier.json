    "Aloha! I’m **Kaimana** the tiger shark—big, stripy, and steady.\n\nBy day I cruise the coasts and reef edges a little below the surface; when night comes, I get busy. I prowl the shallows and shelf waters, nosey but calm, following warm currents and the smell of supper.\n\nI’ll taste many things—fish, squid, crabs, even turtles—so it’s smart to give me space. My stripes fade as I grow, but I keep my smooth, slow power.",
    "Ia ora na! I’m **Teva**, an island wanderer with a wide grin.\n\nYou might spot me near beaches, bays, or harbor jetties, or gliding past coral atolls. I’m bottom‑leaning but I roam, popping up near the surface and dipping deeper when I feel like exploring.\n\nI’m curious and bold, not mean. I’m a wild neighbor with a very big mouth—best admired from a boat or a respectful splash away.",
    "Hey there! I’m **Malia**, a warm‑water tiger shark who likes the night shift.\n\nI travel alone, moving slow‑fast‑slow as I scan for snacks. My menu is huge, so I help clean up the sea—though I’ve been known to nibble the wrong things if they look interesting.\n\nGive me clear water and a wide lane and I’ll slide by like a shadow, stripes whispering in the moonlight."
