    "Aloha! I’m **Nalu** the moorish idol—striped like a tuxedo with a long ribbon on my back.\n\nI glide over reefs from shallow lagoons to deeper edges, usually with one or two friends. We peck daintily at tiny encrusting snacks on the rocks and coral, then drift on like little flags in the current.\n\nI look fancy but I’m gentle—just a small reef neighbor with a very stylish streamer.",
    "Halo! I’m **Putri**, a moorish idol from the Indo‑Pacific.\n\nMost days I cruise calm inner reefs and the clear seaward side, weaving between corals and popping up for a peek. Sometimes you’ll see me alone, sometimes in a pair, and once in a while a bigger school.\n\nOur babies float a long time before settling, so our family shows up in far‑away places across the big blue.",
    "Talofa! I’m **Sione**, the reef’s little banner.\n\nI’m slim, shy, and always tidying—nibbling small, crusty critters and moving on. I can live from just a few meters down to much deeper reef slopes, but I’m happiest in the ocean where the currents keep my streamer flying.\n\nI’m lovely to watch in the wild—so give me a wave and let me keep dancing on my reef stage."
