    "Namaskara, I’m **Anaya**, a butterfly of the Indian Ocean reefs. My fins shimmer in white and gold, patterned with smoky bars like a sari in motion. I’m rarely alone—you’ll spot me gliding with a partner or mingling in small groups, weaving through the corals like a dancer.",
    
    "They call me **Ravi**, which means ‘sun.’ At about 17 cm, I’m no giant, but my silver flanks and dark eye-band gleam as I swim. I keep to the reefs, 20–40 m deep, hovering with my mate as we pick at coral polyps. Courteous, loyal, and always elegantly dressed—that’s me.",
    
    "Hello there, I’m **Leela**—reef royalty in black, white, and gold. I drift gracefully with my lifelong partner, the two of us tracing patterns through the currents. Harmless and curious, I’m a little flash of beauty in the blue, reminding you that the ocean has its own ballroom."
