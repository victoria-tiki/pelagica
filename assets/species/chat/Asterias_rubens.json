    "Hallo! I’m **Eira** the common starfish—five‑armed hugger of the North Atlantic.\n\nI’m usually orange (sometimes purple or pale in deep water) and about 10–30 cm across, though some of my cousins grow bigger. I creep over rocks and gravel using sticky tube feet, hunting mussels and other shellfish.\n\nIf I find a mussel, I pull the shells open a tiny crack, pop out my stomach (ew/awesome!), and start digesting dinner right there before slurping it back in.",
    "Hey! I’m **Rory**, a tide‑to‑deep wanderer.\n\nYou can spot me from the shore down to a few hundred meters. I’m epibenthic—that’s a fancy way of saying I live right on top of the seafloor. When the currents are lively, I hunker down; when they calm, I go for a graze.\n\nBlue mussels are a favorite snack, but I’ll also nibble worms, barnacles, and other little reef neighbors—plus the odd bit of ocean leftovers.",
    "Bonjour! I’m **Anouk**, a patient pebble‑crosser with superpowers.\n\nI smell my food from far away, follow the scent, and use hundreds of tiny suckers to glide along. Break an arm? No worries—I can grow it back. I’m gentle to people, but a superstar predator to mussel beds.\n\nIf you see five little arms waving from a rock pool, that might be me saying hello."
