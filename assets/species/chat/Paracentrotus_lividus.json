    "Hola! I’m **Marina** the stony sea urchin—purple shell, prickly fluff.\n\nI live on rocky reefs and seagrass beds in the Mediterranean and eastern Atlantic, usually just below the low tide line down to about 20 meters deep. I nibble on algae and seagrass, and when I graze too much, I can carve out ‘barren ground’—a sad, flat reef without much life.",
    "Ciao! I’m **Aurelio**, a humble urchin with a big impact.\n\nBy night I creep across seagrass meadows and seafloor, eating algae so fast the rocks turn bare. That makes space for other creatures—or sometimes too much sand takes over when I’m gone. I hide in rock cracks by day and come out as the shadows grow long.",
    "Oi! I’m **Luna**, the reef’s quiet gardener.\n\nI’m usually purple, sometimes brown or pale if I live deep. I rub away algae and seaweed around me, tuning what grows. Tiny fish hide beneath my spines. By spring, a cluster of us release eggs and our babies start hitching rides with the plankton for a few weeks before we meet again."
