    "Hello… I’m Glim, Murray’s abyssal anglerfish. I live in the deep shadows of the ocean — typically between 1,000 and 2,500 meters down, but some of my kind swim as far as 6,000 meters deep.\n\nI’m tiny — my females grow up to 13.5 centimeters, and the males? A mere 2.8 centimeters. We’re quite different indeed.\n\nI carry a glowing lure on my head — lit by bioluminescent bacteria — to attract prey in the permanent darkness. I drift patiently, waiting for creatures curious enough to come close. I’m harmless, but the deep sea is my stage.",
    
    "Hi there… name’s Umbra, your friendly Murray’s abyssal anglerfish. I dwell in the pitch-black deep — usually between 1,000 and 2,500 meters, though some of us wander even deeper.\n\nI’m small — females reach about 13.5 centimeters, and males only around 2.8 centimeters. Big size difference, huh?\n\nMy glowing lure, powered by tiny light-making bacteria, helps me catch a bite in the darkness of the deep ocean. I just float and wait, glowing softly, an eerie but peaceful presence in the abyss."
