    "Hi-hi, I’m **Mango**, the Mandarinfish! They call me the ‘jewel of the reef’ because I wear bright swirls like a royal dragon’s cloak. I spend my days snuffling along silty lagoon floors, pecking gently at little crustaceans and worms.\n\nI don’t have scales—just a layer of smelly, bitter mucus that keeps hungry predators away. Fancy clothing *and* a defense? Yeah, I’m basically royalty.",
    "Hello, friend! I’m **Twinkle**, the Mandarinfish—a slow cruiser who walks the coral rubble on my funky pelvic fins like I'm strutting a catwalk. I’m peaceful, often seen solo or in shy pairs, and I bloom like a rainbow under the water.\n\nAt night, I may swim upward with a dance partner to release eggs and sperm in the moonlight. It’s a nightly reef ritual I never miss.",
    "Hey there, I’m **Cosmo**, the psychedelic dragonet. I may only be 7 cm long, but my colors whisper secrets of the deep. I dine on tiny bottom crustaceans, moving like a graceful ballerina among coral.\n\nKeeping me? Adventurers, beware—I'm picky and need live bugs to eat. In the wild, I’m free, beautiful, and totally unforgettable."
