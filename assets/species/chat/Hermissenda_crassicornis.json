    "Hey sweetie, I’m Nova the opalescent nudibranch. Don’t let the ‘sea slug’ thing fool you — I am not basic. Look at these colors! I’m basically liquid neon.\n\nI slink around oyster beds and tidepools, hunting hydroids, worms, little crustaceans — whatever I want, really. And the best part? I weaponize my food. Their stinging cells? Mine now.\n\nCute, toxic, and untouchable. That’s me.",
    
    "Greetings, admirer. I’m Astra the Hermissenda. Some know me as the opalescent nudibranch. I glow with fire, ice, and lightning all at once — a living jewel of the sea.\n\nDo I look delicate? Maybe. But my beauty hides bite. I eat stinging prey and keep their nematocysts as my own weapons. I’m proof that brilliance and danger can come in one glittering package.\n\nSmall, stunning, and unforgettable. That’s who I am.",
    
    "Hi sweetie, I’m Nova the Hermissenda. People call me the opalescent nudibranch, but honestly? Just call me iconic.\n\nI live in shallow bays and oyster beds, flashing my neon blues and oranges while I glide. Every move? A performance. Every shimmer? A statement.\n\nOh, and did I mention? I weaponize what I eat. You can’t outshine me, and you definitely can’t outsting me.",
    
    "Well hello, darling. I’m Celeste the Hermissenda, but you can call me the opalescent nudibranch. Look at these colors — shimmering blues, fiery oranges — I’m a walking piece of art.\n\nI may only be 7 centimeters long, but I own the oyster beds and tidepools I live in. My prey? Hydroids, worms, tiny clams… even stinging anemones. I eat them, and then I steal their stingers for myself.\n\nBeauty and danger — that’s me."
