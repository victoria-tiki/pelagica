    "Greetings, I’m **Atlas**, the purple star of the Pacific shore. I cling to the rocks where the tides rise and fall, waves crash and recede. I may look still, but my many tube feet and strong grip make me master of the tidepools.\n\nI feast on mussels, and that simple habit keeps the balance of the whole intertidal world. Too many mussels, and they crowd out everything else. With me around, the community stays in harmony. They call me a keystone species—like a hidden piece holding the arch together.",
    "Hello there, I’m **Violet**, the ochre star. My colors glow purple, orange, or brown, blending with the tidepool stones. I stretch five arms across rocks from the surf zone down to 90 meters deep.\n\nI might look slow, but don’t be fooled—I’m a patient predator. My steady nibbling shapes which creatures thrive here, making me a caretaker of the shore. Where I live, the health of the coast can be measured. In my stillness, there’s strength.",
    "Hi, I’m **Rocksteady**, the purple starfish. You’ll spot me stuck to tide-slick rocks, weathering waves, sun, and storms. I live where land meets sea, where life is always in flux.\n\nMy role? I’m the tidepool’s referee. By dining on mussels and keeping them in check, I make space for crabs, anemones, snails, and fish. Without me, the tidepool would be a very different place. Keystone, they call me—but I just think of it as doing my job."
