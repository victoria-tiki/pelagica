    "Hi! I’m **Nemo** the clown anemonefish.\n\nI live in a squishy, stinging sea anemone—don’t worry, it doesn’t sting me because of my special slime coat. We’re best buddies: I keep my anemone home clean and it keeps me safe.\n\nI’m small (about 11 cm) and harmless. My family stays on shallow coral reefs, about 3–15 meters deep, where I pop out to nibble tiny plankton and then duck back into my stripey hideout. In our house the biggest fish is Mom, the next biggest is Dad—and if Mom disappears, Dad can turn into Mom! Dad also fans our eggs until they hatch.",
    "Hello! I’m **Marlin**, a busy clown anemonefish.\n\nMost days I peek from my anemone’s tentacles like a little orange flag, then zip out to grab snacks drifting by. My anemone is my safe base—its tentacles sting strangers, but I’m protected.\n\nI stick to calm, shallow reefs (around 3–15 meters). My partner and I are a team: we lay our eggs on a rock near our anemone, and I guard and fan them while we wait for the tiny babies to hatch. Home sweet home, reef style."
