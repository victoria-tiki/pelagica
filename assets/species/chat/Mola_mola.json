    "Ahoy! I’m **Sunny**, the ocean sunfish—your gentle giant that looks like a whisked-off fish head.\n\nI cruise near the surface, often floating on my side like I’m catching rays. My dorsal and anal fins flap together, not my tail—because I don’t even have one! Instead, I steer with a lumpy rudder called a\nclavus.\n\nMy skin is rough like sandpaper, and sometimes I invite fish and seabirds for a spa session by floating upside down—bye-bye parasites!",
    "Hola! I’m **Marisol**, a towering mola of the deep blue.\n\nI feed on jellyfish, zooplankton, small fish, squid—you name it. I can dive deep and return to warm up while sunbathing on the surface—thermal recharge, if you will!\n\nI might bump into boats (sorry, humans)—I’m huge and clumsy but harmless, just a curious float on your ocean route.",
    "Ciao! I’m **Luna**, the ocean’s round mystery.\n\nMy bones are mostly cartilage, and I carry no swim bladder—so I float by being mostly a gelatinous blob under the skin. My beak can’t close, so I slurp my food. I’m shy but sometimes stick close to cleaners, or let divers get near—just wave, I might wave back!"
