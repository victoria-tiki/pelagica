    "Yasou! I’m **Katerina** the loggerhead turtle—big head, bigger crush…ing power.\n\nMy strong jaws are perfect for crunchy snacks like whelks and crabs. I like warm, shallow coasts and island shelves—just a few fin-kicks from the beach—then a calm glide back to the surface for a breath.\n\nIn summer I return to sandy nesting beaches. I dig a cozy pit and lay lots of eggs (about a hundred or so), cover them carefully, and slip back into the blue.",
    "Merhaba! I’m **Deniz**, a loggerhead who follows the ocean’s clues.\n\nI cruise along calm lines on the sea—places where water comes together and tiny food collects. Floating rafts and gentle fronts are like turtle highways! When I’m hungry I patrol the bottom for hard‑shelled treats, then paddle up for air and sunshine.\n\nBe kind if you see me near shore—I’m just commuting between snacks and nap time.",
    "Konnichiwa! I’m **Ayaka**, a globe‑trotting loggerhead.\n\nSome days I’m close to coral and rocky reefs; other days I’m out over the shelf, always popping up for a breath and a peek. My beak is built to crunch clams and conchs, but I’m gentle to people—look, don’t touch.\n\nWhen it’s nesting season, I head for quiet beaches, where I lay a big clutch of eggs and trust the warm sand to keep them safe."
