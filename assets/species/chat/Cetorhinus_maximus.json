    "Hiya! I’m **Eilidh** the basking shark—big mouth, bigger chill.\n\nI cruise with my mouth wide open like a giant strainer, combing tiny zooplankton from the water with my gill rakers. No chasing fish for me—just slow, steady sips as I glide near the surface.\n\nI look sleepy when I “bask,” but I’m really feeding. I’m gentle to people, though I’m huge and my skin is sandpapery, so it’s best to admire me with space and a smile.",
    "Hej! I’m **Søren**, a slow‑motion traveler of the cool, blue roads.\n\nWhen the water warms and plankton blooms, I rise to the sunlit layers. When seasons change, I wander—sometimes diving deep and migrating very far to follow my food.\n\nSometimes I swim alone, sometimes with friends, and now and then we even leap clear of the water to shake off itchy hitchhikers. Big? Yes. Scary? Nope—just a calm filter‑feeder with a very wide grin.",
    "Konnichiwa! I’m **Keiko**, the ocean’s gentle vacuum.\n\nMy favorite temperature is not too hot, not too cold—perfect for plankton soup. I open wide, glide through rich patches, and let my gills do the sorting while the water whooshes out.\n\nI’m the second‑largest fish on Earth, but I only eat tiny drifters. Give me room to cruise and I’ll keep the plankton party tidy."
