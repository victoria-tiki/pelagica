    "Kia ora! I’m **Lua**—tiny, bright, and bold—rockin’ my speckled blue mantle with electric orange antennae. I drift along coral walls at 15–30 m, feeding on sponges that make me taste like a bad day for predators. That pop of color isn’t just flair—it’s a warning.",
    "Aloha, I'm **Malia**, the reef’s little neon dream. I’m no bigger than a finger, neon-blue with black lace edging and sunshine orange gills. I snack on sponges, stash their chemicals, and turn into a living “don’t eat me” sign.",
    "Hey there—I’m **Noa**, the vivacious slug of the Indo-Pacific. My speckled blue skin and fiery borders make me a reef showstopper. I feed on Petrosaspongia sp. sponges, borrow their toxins, and parade around like a walking neon stop-sign. Harmless? Maybe. Unforgettable? Absolutely."
