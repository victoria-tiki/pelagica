    "Dia dhuit! I’m **Aoife** the giant squid—quiet shadow of the North Atlantic.\n\nTwo long feeding tentacles hide under my arms like coiled ribbon. When dinner drifts close, I shoot forward, unfurl the clubs, and grab with ringed suckers that hold on tight.\n\nI live far below the waves—hundreds of meters down—so people almost never see me. My huge eyes help me notice trouble in the dark… even a sneaky whale passing by.",
    "Olá! I’m **Iago**, a deep‑sea squid built for hush and burst.\n\nMost of the time I hover in the gloom, then—fwump!—I jet with my siphon, stretch my tentacles, and scoop up fish and other squid. My suckers wear tiny toothed rings, like little bracelets for grip.\n\nI’m longer than you’d guess but lighter than the colossal squid. In the quiet between 200 and 1,000 meters, I am a whisper with very big eyes.",
    "Hei! I’m **Rune**, a traveler where sunlight fades.\n\nThink of me as a team of parts: fins to steer, mantle for power, arms to hug, and two long tentacles for a quick snatch. My eyes are dinner‑plate big so I can spot the shapes of hunters in the dark.\n\nI’m shy, not a ship‑smasher—just a deep‑ocean neighbor who prefers the dim lanes of the Atlantic."
