    "Hei! I’m **Sigrid** the witch flounder—no spells here, just a very flat fish.\n\nI settle into soft, muddy seafloors where it’s cool and quiet, then I wiggle and *poof*—I’m camouflaged. Both my eyes sit on the same (right) side so I can peek up while I lie flat.\n\nWhen snacks wander by—little crabs, worms, brittle stars, even small fish—I scoot forward and gulp. Calm, careful, cozy… that’s my bottom‑dweller life.",
    "Hullo! I’m **Ewan**, a witch flounder from the North Atlantic.\n\nI look like a pancake with fins, sliding just above the mud. My mouth is small, but it’s perfect for nibbling crunchy crustaceans and wiggly polychaete worms.\n\nI’m harmless and patient. Most days I nap on the seafloor, then glide a few fin‑beats to a new hiding spot where the current brings dinner to me.",
    "Sæll! I’m **Bryndis**, a right‑eyed witch flounder.\n\nBoth eyes on one side means I can watch the water while I rest on the bottom. I love fine, muddy places on the continental shelf and slope—quiet neighborhoods for a shy flatfish.\n\nI don’t chase much; I wait. When something tasty passes, I flick sand, slide forward, and *snack!* Back to blending in."
