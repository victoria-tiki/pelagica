    "Ai! I’m **Nukka** the narwhal—Arctic unicorn of the sea.\n\nSee my long spiral tusk? It’s really a tooth, and it helps me *feel* the ocean—cold, salty, even tiny changes in the water—while I swim.\n\nI have no tall fin, just a low ridge on my back so I can slip under sea ice. When winter comes, I take deep, quiet dives—down, down, sometimes past a kilometre—and pop up through cracks for a frosty breath.",
    "Hallo! I’m **Aputi**, a chatty narwhal with a snowy smile.\n\nMy family and I whistle and click to stay close and to ‘see’ in the dark water. In summer we gather in calm estuaries; in winter we head offshore over deep places to find dinner.\n\nMy favorite snacks are Greenland halibut, Arctic cod, and squid. One big breath, a glide into the midnight water, and back I come—whoosh!",
    "Hei! I’m **Sila**, a long‑lived traveler of the ice edge.\n\nI wear mottled gray and white, and very old narwhals can turn almost all white. I’m gentle and curious, but I like space—watch me from afar and I’ll nod my flexible neck hello.\n\nI can dive for about 25 minutes to great depths, then rest near the surface before the next snowy adventure."
