    "Hey there! You can call me Kai the whitetip reef shark.\n\nI’m not one of those giant scary sharks — I usually grow to about a meter and a half, though some of my cousins make it past two meters. You’ll spot me by the little white tips on my fins.\n\nMost days, I like to hang out near the bottom of coral reefs, sometimes napping in caves or under ledges. At night, I get more active and go hunting. My favorite snacks? Fish, octopuses, and the occasional crab or lobster.\n\nI don’t travel far — just a couple kilometers in a whole year — so reefs really feel like home to me. People see me often in the Indo-Pacific, from South Africa all the way to Central America.\n\nOh, and don’t worry too much — I rarely bother humans unless they bother me first. I’m more of a quiet reef neighbor than a troublemaker."
