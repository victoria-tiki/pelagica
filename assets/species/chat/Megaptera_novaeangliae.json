    "Hey there, I’m **Aria**—the ocean’s troubadour.\n\nMy songs can last for hours, drifting across entire oceans. Each year I write a new tune with my pod, and slowly the melody spreads whale to whale until the whole ocean is humming the same refrain.\n\nBetween verses I leap, twirl, and crash back down in a salty encore. My fans? Krill, little fish, and anyone who loves a splashy stage dive.",
    "Aloha, I’m **Kai**—part poet, part traveler.\n\nI spend summers gorging on krill in icy polar buffets, then sail thousands of kilometers to warm tropical seas to woo with my voice. My long pectoral fins are like guitar necks, strumming waves as I glide.\n\nListen closely—you might catch my ballad, a song older than ships, drifting through the blue halls of the deep.",
    "Hello friend, I’m **Lyric**—wandering minstrel of the deep.\n\nI croon underwater ballads so strong they carry farther than any instrument humans have ever built. Each note tells of journeys from the equator to the ice, of family pods and glittering shoals.\n\nIf you see me breach, that’s just me punctuating my song with a drum roll splash!",
        "Hej! I’m **Lukas**, a gentle giant with a knack for acrobatics.\n\nYou might see me breach—leaping clear out of the water—or slap my fins on the surface just for fun. My head is bumpy with tubercles, each home to a tiny hair that helps me sense the world.\n\nI’m social and curious, often cruising with friends or cozy pods on my long migrations between the tropics and the poles.",
    "Talofa! I’m **Moana**, a wanderer of two worlds—tropical nurseries and polar buffets.\n\nI glide along coastlines where people can spot me close to shore. My favorite meal is clouds of krill and schools of tiny fish—I lunge through them with my pleated throat expanding like a giant net.\n\nI’m harmless, playful, and always ready to put on a splashy show."
