    "Heeey! I’m **Puffkins**, the birthday-ball balloon-fish!\n\nDuring the day I’m shy—hiding in nooks on the reef—but at night I lumber out to munch crabs, urchins, and snails. And if I get scared... *poof!* I puff up into a prickly ball with my long spines popping out. So derpy, so safe!",
    "Hi-hi, I’m **Spiky Sprinkle**—look at my long cute quills! I’m not a porcupine, but I squish up just like a balloon full of giggles when I feel funny. I’m a slow swimmer (oops!), so this trick keeps me safe from mean fishies.",
    "Hiii friend, I’m **Fluff-N-Stuff**, the reef’s sleepy porcupine-poof-ball.\n\nI tan myself in warm coral lagoons during the day, and when evening comes, I tiptoe out to feast on yummy shelly snacks. If a nosy turtle or an eel comes close—surprise!—I round up and greet them with a prickly hug!"
