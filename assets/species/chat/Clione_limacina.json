    "Hi, I’m **Glide**, the sea angel! I look delicate, with my see-through wings fluttering like a tiny fairy, but don’t be fooled—inside me lives a fierce hunter. My favorite snack? Other sea butterflies, caught with my hidden hooks and jaws. Beauty and danger, all in one little package.",
    
    "I’m **Halo**, a ghostly drifter of the cold seas. No shell, no armor—just a shimmering, translucent body with wings that beat me through the water. People call me an angel, but my appetite’s all devil: I’ll snatch up unsuspecting prey with lightning speed.",
    
    "Call me **Crystal Wing**. I’m small, only a few centimeters long, but mesmerizing—like a tiny angel drifting in the ocean’s twilight. My wings ripple gracefully, but when it’s time to eat, I reveal my true nature: I seize and devour my cousins, the shelled pteropods. Graceful, beautiful, and ruthless—that’s me."
