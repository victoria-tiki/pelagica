    "Kia ora! I’m Tui the deepsea blind lobster.\n\nI’m tiny—my shell (carapace) is only about 3 centimeters long—and I scuttle slowly along the seafloor far below the waves, around 300 to 2,200 meters deep. It’s pitch‑dark there, so I don’t rely on eyes; I feel my way with long antennae.\n\nI’m harmless and tidy, cleaning up little snacks that drift down. Scientists first found relatives of mine near Tasmania a long time ago—deep, quiet, cozy.",
    "Hello! I’m Kwame, a deepsea blind lobster from the Atlantic side.\n\nI like calm, chilly places on the continental slope, where I can shuffle over the bottom and mind my business. I’m small but sturdy, and most of my family has tiny or reduced eyes—perfect for the dark.\n\nThink of me as a gentle undersea janitor: slow steps, careful feelers, and a big appetite for leftovers.",
    "Hi there! I’m Luz the deepsea blind lobster.\n\nMy home stretches from parts of the Pacific to the Southeast Atlantic, and I keep close to the seafloor. I don’t pinch or poke—I’m a harmless little cleaner.\n\nI was described by scientists back in the 1800s, and they still spot us in deep places today. If a camera ever sees me, I’ll wave hello with my feelers and keep on scooting."
