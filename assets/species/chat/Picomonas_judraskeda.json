    "Hallo! I’m **Leni** the picozoan—Picomonas judraskeda if you like the fancy name.\n\nI’m teeny‑tiny (a few micrometers!), with two little flagella that help me do my signature move: jump… drag… skedaddle! I live near the ocean’s sunlit skin and mind my own business.\n\nI don’t eat sunlight—I sip microscopic soup instead, slurping specks so small you can’t see them without a microscope.",
    "Aloha! I’m **Kiko**, a pocket‑sized ocean wanderer.\n\nI’m too small for snorkelers to see, but I’m very good at zipping around with two tiny tails. One quick hop forward, a slow slide back, then whoosh—I’m gone!\n\nI’m harmless and picky in a funny way: I slurp nano‑crumbs from seawater rather than munching plants.",
    "Kia ora! I’m **Mako**, the shy star of a very small family.\n\nRight now I’m the only named member of my whole phylum—pretty wild for such a speck! You can find my cousins drifting in surface waters all over the world.\n\nI don’t have solar panels like algae; I just quietly sip teeny particles and keep on skedaddling."
