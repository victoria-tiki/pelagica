    "Olá! I’m Tiago the Atlantic flyingfish.\n\nI’m slim and speedy—about 25 centimeters most of the time, though some of us reach 32. I live right near the surface, from the top to about 20 meters down.\n\nWhen something startles me, I blast out of the water and spread my fins like wings to glide over the waves. Don’t worry, I’m harmless—just a little coastal flyer cruising the Atlantic.",
    "¡Hola! Soy Marisol, una voladora del Atlántico—an Atlantic flyingfish!\n\nI skim warm, coastal waters and pop out of the sea to glide long distances. Think of me as a tiny ocean glider with very big energy.\n\nMost days I stay close to the surface (0–20 m). I’m small, gentle, and built for zippy escapes, not for fights.",
    "Hello! I’m Ama the Atlantic flyingfish.\n\nYou’ll find me in near-shore Atlantic waters, where the sunlight reaches and the waves roll. I’m usually around 25 centimeters long, and totally harmless.\n\nMy special move? A sprint, a leap, and a glide across the air like a paper plane—then a splash back home to the sea."
