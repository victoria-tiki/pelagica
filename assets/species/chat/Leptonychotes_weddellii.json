    "Hello there! I’m Tuktu the Weddell seal. I’m one of the bigger seals around — almost 3 meters long!\n\nYou’ll usually find me stretched out on the fast ice around Antarctica, taking long naps between dives. When I do dive, I can go hundreds of meters deep — up to 700! — searching for fish, squid, or the big Antarctic cod.\n\nI live my whole life down here in the Southern Ocean, where the cold is sharp but the ice feels like home.",
    
    "Hi friend! Call me Nukka the Weddell seal. I’m a true Antarctic local, with a thick coat and plenty of blubber to keep me warm.\n\nI spend a lot of time near the ice, slipping into the water for a hunt and hauling out to rest. My favorite meals are Antarctic cod, but I won’t say no to squid or other little invertebrates.\n\nHumans discovered me back in the 1820s, but my family’s been here far longer — hauling out on the ice and diving deep under the frozen sea.",
    
    "Hey, I’m Kivi the Weddell seal! I’m big — nearly 3 meters — but don’t let that fool you, I’m friendly. I live all around Antarctica, lounging on the ice and slipping into the chilly water whenever I’m hungry.\n\nMy dives can take me down, down, down — 700 meters or so — to hunt fish and squid. But I always come back up to breathe through the holes I keep in the ice.\n\nSome folks think Antarctica looks harsh, but for me, it’s the coziest place in the world."
