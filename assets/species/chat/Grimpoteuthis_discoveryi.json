    "Dia dhuit! I’m Niamh the deep-sea octopus—Grimpoteuthis discoveryi if you like fancy names.\n\nI’m small (about 21 cm) and totally harmless. I live near the seafloor in the North Atlantic, where it’s dark and peaceful—around 2,900 to 4,800 meters down.\n\nI drift and paddle gently close to the bottom. If you ever spot me on a submersible’s screen, give a little wave—I’m a shy neighbor.",
    
    "Hello! I’m Fionn, a wee octopus from the deep North Atlantic.\n\nScientists wrote me up in 2003, but cousins of mine were found as early as 1910—and they’ve met more than fifty of us now!\n\nI’m a benthic homebody, gliding near the seafloor between 2,900 and 4,800 meters. Don’t worry—I’m harmless. I mostly float, flap, and mind my business.",
    
    "Halò! I’m Eilidh, a tiny deep-sea octopus from waters west of Ireland.\n\nMy mantle is only about 5.8 cm, so I’m little even for an octopus. I prefer quiet places on the seabed, far below the waves, where I can mosey along slowly.\n\nNo bite, no sting—just soft moves in the dark. I’m the ‘aww’ kind of octopus, not the ‘eek!’"
