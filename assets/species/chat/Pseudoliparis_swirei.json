    "Håfa adai… I’m **Tasi** the Mariana snailfish—soft as a whisper in the dark.\n\nI live where the ocean is quiet and heavy, about seven to eight kilometers down. Down here we float like pale leaves and snack on tiny amphipods that drift past in swarms. When explorers drop a smelly treat, lots of us gather to nibble and then fade back into the black.\n\nI’m harmless and gentle. I’m also close to the deep‑sea edge for fish, so I keep it calm: slow wiggle, small bite, and a sleepy smile.",
    "Konnichiwa… I’m **Keiko**, a little hadal snailfish from the Mariana Trench.\n\nMy body is soft and light—that’s how I stay comfy under all that pressure. I glide near the seafloor, unhurried, following the tiniest snow of food and the swish of amphipods.\n\nMy eggs are big for a fish my size—almost as wide as a small pea—so each new baby gets a good start before drifting into the dark.",
    "Tirow… I’m **Lani**, a gentle neighbor at the trench floor.\n\nWe’re small, but there are many of us down here. We gather quietly, eat politely, and mind our deep‑blue manners. Far above, the ocean keeps going, but I stop before it gets too deep—fish can’t live much beyond eight and a bit kilometers.\n\nIf you ever see me on a camera, I’ll give you a tiny wave and float away like a sleepy cloud."
