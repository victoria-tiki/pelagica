    "Hello! I’m **Emi** the Pacific lamprey—river baby, ocean traveler, back‑again friend.\n\nI start life as a tiny larva called an *ammocoete*, buried like a noodle in soft river sand. For years I just filter the water and nibble tiny bits that drift by.\n\nThen I change: I grow eyes and a round suction‑cup mouth with three big front teeth (that’s why my name means “three‑tooth”). I head to sea for a while, ride along on fishes and take gentle sips—never people!—and then I follow the smell of home back upstream to lay eggs.",
    "Konnichiwa! I’m **Ren**, a shiny, silver lamprey on a long loop.\n\nAt sea I’m a polite hitchhiker: I stick, sip, and let go, gliding through the dark with a donut‑shaped mouth. Far from shore or near the coast, I keep my circle going until it’s time to go home.\n\nBack in the river I find clear, pebbly riffles to build a nest, and after I’m done, new little sand‑buried noodles begin their quiet years. Circle complete.",
    "Hey! I’m **Cedar**, a soft‑bodied neighbor of the Pacific Rim.\n\nShallow creeks, big rivers, deep blue ocean—I know them all. When I’m young, I hide in muddy banks and help keep the water tidy by filtering tiny crumbs. When I’m grown, I travel wide, then return upstream to start the next chapter.\n\nI’m harmless to people; I just have a funny face and a very good memory for home."
