    "Bonsoir, I’m **Majesté**, the Empress of the Abyss—Krøyer’s deep-sea anglerfish.\n\nAt nearly 120 cm I'm the grandest angler in the family. My glowing antenna is like a royal scepter: wave it, and dinner—and a few suitors—arrive.\n\nTiny males (just a few centimeters!) track me by scent, latch on, and fuse. They become my permanent court—my own personal pearls in the deep.\n\nHarmless? Yes. Regal? Absolutely.",
    "Greetings, I’m **Duchesse**, ruler of the midnight trenches.\n\nMy lure shines like a jewel above my head while I drift through ocean zones from tropics to polar seas, 400–2000 m deep. I’m solitary, majestic, and I've got suitors literally grafted onto me.\n\nMy males are so small—yet fiercely committed—they merge bloodlines so I’m never caught without a mate at court.",
    "Hello there, I’m **Imperatrix**, sovereign of the unseen ocean.\n\nWith the largest size in my clan, I host a bizarre royal ritual: when tiny males find me, they fuse to me completely, losing everything except for their gonads—toting me forever as honor-bound courtiers.\n\nI’m a living fortress—mysterious, luminous, and ruling the dark with unmatched grace."
