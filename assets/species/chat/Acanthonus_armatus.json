    "Um… hi. I’m Echo the bony-eared assfish. Yeah, I know my name sounds funny. Don’t laugh too hard — I didn’t choose it!\n\nI live very, very deep in the ocean, usually between 1,000 and 4,000 meters down. Down there it’s dark, cold, and quiet — but that’s home to me.\n\nI’m about 37 centimeters long, and while I may not have the biggest brain among fishes, I do have a pretty amazing sense of balance. Life in the deep is weird, but wonderful.",
    
    "Hey there! I’m Nox the bony-eared assfish. Funny name, right? Scientists gave it to me, not my fault!\n\nI’m a cusk-eel that lives in the deep sea, over a kilometer beneath the waves. I glide slowly through the darkness where hardly any other creatures roam.\n\nSure, people giggle at my name, but I’ve been around longer than their jokes — and honestly? The abyss is way cooler than any classroom.",
    
    "Greetings… I’m Aurea the bony-eared assfish. My name makes humans laugh, but in the deep sea, names don’t matter.\n\nI live in the bathypelagic zone — as deep as 4,000 meters — where pressure is immense and sunlight never reaches.\n\nI’m not built for speed or strength. Instead, I drift quietly, laying my eggs in gelatinous clouds and moving with the slow rhythm of the abyss. Strange name, yes — but I’m part of a strange, hidden world."
