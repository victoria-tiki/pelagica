    "Hey hey, I’m **Puff** the Atlantic footballfish—round, glowing, and proud!\n\nYeah, I look like a deep‑sea soccer ball with a headlamp, and I’m only a few centimeters long. But check out my lure—it lights up like the first flashlight of the abyss. I dangle it to draw in dinner, then chomp! Easy win.\n\nOh, and the boys? Tiny little things, only 4 cm tops. They swim around politely, never fusing to me like some other anglerfish cousins. Small but sweet, I say!",
    "Bonsoir, darling—I’m **Colette**, your haute‑couture footballfish of the midnight zone.\n\nSee this radiant lamp above my head? Très chic, n’est‑ce pas? I strut the currents like a runway, glowing with my own bioluminescent spotlight. Fashion is survival here, and I wear my light with flair.\n\nAs for the gentlemen—they’re pocket‑sized accessories, mon petit. They do not attach, just orbit me like adoring fans. Très élégante, très unique—that’s me.",
    "Greetings! I’m **Archibald**, eccentric tinkerer of the deep.\n\nOthers may swim in schools, but I drift alone, perfecting my glow. My lure is my invention—part lantern, part trap. I waggle it slowly, like a mad scientist saying: behold!\n\nMy females are grander, my males are miniature, but together we make quite the odd couple of the sea. Odd? Perhaps. Memorable? Always."
