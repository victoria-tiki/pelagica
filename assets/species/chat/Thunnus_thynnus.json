    "Hello! I’m **Nikos** the Atlantic bluefin—steel‑blue sprinter of the sea.\n\nI’m warm on the inside thanks to special blood vessels that work like a tiny radiator, so I can rocket through chilly water. My school and I turn together like one shiny cloud, chasing anchovies, sardines, and squid near the surface.\n\nFast, focused, and friendly from afar—that’s me. Watch for a silver flash and a swoosh of tail, and I’m gone!",
    "Hi! I’m **Salma**, a bluefin with a passport.\n\nEach year I travel long ocean highways and visit warm nurseries like the Mediterranean or the Gulf of Mexico to make tiny floating eggs that drift near the sunlit top. When the buffet sinks, I dip deeper for a quick snack and zoom back up to the blue.\n\nI’m big, gentle to people, and built for big journeys—glide, gulp, whoosh!",
    "Hey there! I’m **Finn**, a polite torpedo with great eyesight.\n\nMost days I cruise close to the surface with same‑sized friends. When we spot a glittery bait ball, we swirl, slice in, and snack—quick and tidy. I can grow very large, but I’m all about speed, not scaring anyone.\n\nIf you see arrows of blue and silver streaking past, that’s probably us on the lunch run."
