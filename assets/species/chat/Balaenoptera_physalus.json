    "Hei! I’m **Sigrid** the fin whale—sleek and super speedy.\n\nI’m huge, but I fly through the water like a silver train. When I find a cloud of krill or schooling fish, I open wide and *lunge*—one giant gulp—then my baleen strains out dinner while the water whooshes away.\n\nLook close at my smile: one lower jaw is pale and the other is dark. It’s my little ocean secret.",
    "Ciao! I’m **Marco**, a fin whale cruising the blue highways where deep water meets the coast.\n\nBy day I glide with a few friends; at feeding time I dive down and zoom back up to scoop krill. I’m gentle to people, but very fast when I need to be—some call me the greyhound of the sea.\n\nIf you spot a tall, straight blow and a long, lean back, that might be me passing by.",
    "Konnichiwa! I’m **Aiko**, a fin whale with a quiet voice and a big appetite.\n\nSometimes I feed near the surface, and other times I dip into the dim water for a deeper meal. My belly pleats stretch like an accordion when I gulp, then shrink again as I strain the water out.\n\nI roam far across the oceans, following krill and fish, then breathe, glide, and go—steady as a heartbeat."
