    "KAPOW! I’m **Smash**, the peacock mantis shrimp—the reef’s prizefighter! My punch is faster than a bullet and strong enough to crack crab shells and even aquarium glass. Don’t mess with me, or you’ll feel the lightning!\n\nOh, and my eyes? They see colors you can’t even imagine—ultraviolet, polarized light, the whole rainbow and more. Basically, I’m the superhero of the sea.",
    "Hey there, I’m **Rainbow Rumble**. Small body, big attitude! I strut through coral reefs wearing a dazzling suit of green, orange, and blue. With my hammer-claws, I smash open snails and crabs like they’re peanuts.\n\nScientists say my strike is one of the fastest movements in the animal kingdom. I just say—it’s fun being awesome.",
    "Yo! I’m **Punchy**, the mantis shrimp with the knockout swing. I’m about 18 cm long, but don’t let that fool you—I can punch with the force of a .22 caliber bullet.\n\nI live in burrows, peek out with my googly eyes, and then—WHAM! Dinner served. Bright, bold, and unstoppable—that’s me."
