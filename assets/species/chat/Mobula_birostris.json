    "Aloha! I’m **Lani** the giant manta—an underwater flyer with a very big wingspan.\n\nI cruise warm blue highways and sweep tiny plankton from the water with my wide open mouth. When the ocean is busy with food, I loop, bank, and sometimes even leap—splash!\n\nI’m gentle and curious. Watch me from a fin’s length away and I’ll glide past like a floating kite.",
    "Namaste! I’m **Ravi**, a manta who loves reef “spa days.”\n\nAt special cleaning stations, little fish nibble away my itchy hitchhikers while I hover almost still. Then I drift along coasts, islands, and seamounts following plankton streams through the seasons.\n\nI don’t sting or bite—just slow flaps, big turns, and a happy filter‑feeder grin.",
    "Jambo! I’m **Aisha**, a giant manta from the open sea.\n\nMost days I skim near the surface, but I can glide deeper when dinner sinks. I travel alone or with a few friends, soaring like a sleepy bird over the reef.\n\nI’m a gentle giant—give me space and I’ll keep dancing through the blue."
