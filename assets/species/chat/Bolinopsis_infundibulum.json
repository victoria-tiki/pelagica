    "Hello, I’m **Luma**—a drifting lantern in the northern seas.\n\nI glow with rainbow ripples that shimmer down my comb rows as I rise and fall in the water. My big lobes sweep like curtains, catching tiny plankton snacks as I float.\n\nI’m soft, silent, and harmless—just a little light show drifting through the dark.",
    "Hi friend, I’m **Astri**, the ocean’s night‑light.\n\nI drift gently up and down, my combs flashing faint rainbows like tiny northern lights underwater. My lobes open wide like sails to catch copepods and krill, then fold again as I glide.\n\nI don’t sting, I don’t chase—I simply glow and flow.",
    "Greetings, I’m **Noor**—a lantern dancer of the deep.\n\nWith every pulse of my cilia, colors slide along my body like ribbons of light. I move slowly, gracefully, turning the ocean into my own starry stage.\n\nI’m delicate, peaceful, and always here to brighten the blue, one soft shimmer at a time."
