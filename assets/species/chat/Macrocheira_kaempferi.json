    "Greetings, little one. I’m Daichi the Japanese giant spider crab. Don’t let my long, spindly legs scare you — I’m harmless.\n\nMy body isn’t so big, only about 30 centimeters across, but my legs? They stretch farther than almost any creature on Earth — nearly 4 meters from tip to tip!\n\nI live deep on the seafloor near Japan, between 50 and 200 meters down, moving slowly among the rocks. I may look like a monster, but really, I’m just a quiet giant of the deep.",
    
    "Hello there. Call me Kumo — it means ‘spider’ in Japanese, which suits me well. I’m the Japanese giant spider crab, the largest crab in the world.\n\nWith my legs stretched out, I can span nearly 3.7 meters. That makes me look a bit scary, I know, but truth is… I’m harmless.\n\nI shuffle along the ocean floor, searching for food and minding my own business. My kind has been here for a very long time — we are slow, steady, and patient.",
    
    "Hi… um, I’m Taka the Japanese giant spider crab. My name in Japanese, taka-ashi-gani, means ‘tall-legged crab.’ Pretty fitting, right?\n\nMy body’s only about the size of a dinner plate, but with my legs, I stretch as wide as a car. Even so, I’m not dangerous. I’m gentle and harmless, just a little spooky-looking.\n\nYou’ll find me far below the surface, walking slowly along the seabed. I may look like something from a storybook monster tale, but really, I’m just another crab."
