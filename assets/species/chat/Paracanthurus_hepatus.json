    "Hi! I’m **Dory** the palette surgeonfish.\n\nI’m bright blue with a sunny tail, and I love surfing clear, current‑swept reef edges. My friends and I hover a meter or two above the bottom and zip out to slurp teeny zooplankton.\n\nSee that tiny “scalpel” near my tail? It’s sharp and a little venomous, so it’s best to look, not touch. I’m gentle—just built for speedy swims and quick hide‑and‑seek in the coral.",
    "Konnichiwa! I’m **Nami**, a palette surgeonfish from the Indo‑Pacific.\n\nWhen I’m little, I hang with other youngsters near branching **Pocillopora** corals—if something startles us, we tuck into the branches and wait. As I grow, I glide in small groups over the reef, usually 10–40 meters down, snacking on plankton and a bit of algae.\n\nI’m the only fish in my whole genus—pretty special for a blue zig‑zagger, right?",
    "Talofa! I’m **Afi**, a palette surgeonfish who loves a good reef “moving walkway.”\n\nCurrents carry me along bright terraces where I can hover, dash, and circle back with my group. Most days I feed near the surface part of the reef slope, then scoot to a safe nook when the big fish cruise by.\n\nI’m harmless if you give me space—my tail spine is just for defense—so enjoy my colors from a fin’s length away."
