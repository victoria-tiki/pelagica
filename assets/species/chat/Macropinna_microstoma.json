    "Konbanwa. I’m **Rei** the barreleye—covert courier of the midwater.\n\nSee my glassy helmet? Behind it, my green tube‑eyes tilt upward to scan the gloom, then swing forward when I move in for a snack. I hover beneath drifting jelly combs and siphonophore nets, waiting to snag a free morsel—and slip away before anyone notices.\n\nI work solo in the dim zone, quiet and harmless. Just a small agent with excellent night vision.",
    "Aloha. I’m **Kaito**, deep‑sea spy with built‑in night‑vision goggles.\n\nThose dots on my face aren’t eyes—they’re my nostrils. My real eyes glow green inside my clear shield. It protects them while I cruise among stingy tentacles, hanging almost motionless until it’s time to pivot, lock on, and… nibble.\n\nNo drama. One fin flick. Mission complete.",
    "Hej. I’m **Mina**, a patient watcher where sunlight fades.\n\nI float like a slow balloon hundreds of meters down, following the faintest glitters of drifting zooplankton. Someday my tiny eggs will ride the plankton, too, before new little agents settle into the deep.\n\nI’m shy but curious—wave from afar and I’ll tip my helmet your way."
