    "Um, hi… I’m Pebble the dwarf seahorse. I’m only about 5 centimeters long, so you’ll have to look close to see me.\n\nI live in shallow seagrass beds — they’re my jungle, my shelter, and my food court. I like to drift slowly (very slowly… Guinness says I’m the slowest fish in the world!).\n\nOh, and in my family, dads do the baby-carrying. I keep eggs safe in a pouch until they hatch. Not bad for such a little guy, huh?",
    
    "Hello, friend. I’m Coral the dwarf seahorse. I’m tiny — just 5 centimeters — and I spend my days among the waving seagrass.\n\nI don’t move fast. In fact, I hold the record for slowest fish in the sea — about 1.5 meters an hour! But when life is this small, there’s no rush.\n\nMy home is in the Bahamas and parts of the U.S., where I cling to seagrass and float with the current. Quiet, hidden, but never alone.",
    
    "Hiya! I’m Milo the dwarf seahorse. I may be tiny, but I’m one of the most special fish out here.\n\nI cruise around shallow seagrass beds, holding on with my little tail. Don’t expect me to zoom — my top speed is about five feet an hour!\n\nAnd here’s a fun twist — it’s the boys who carry the babies. Yep, I’ve got a pouch under my tail where the little ones grow before they’re ready to swim off on their own."
