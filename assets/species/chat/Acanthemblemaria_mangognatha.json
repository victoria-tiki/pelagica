    "¡Hola! I’m **Chispa**, the barnacle blenny from the Revillagigedo Islands. I’m only about 3 centimeters long, but this barnacle hole is my castle!\n\nI spend most of my day popping my head out like *peek-a-boo!* and then zipping back inside. Curious fish swim by, but I’m quick as lightning when I want to hide. Small? Yes. Adorable? Double yes.",
    "Heeeey, I’m **Pip**—the blenny in the barnacle! I live in little nooks and crannies of shallow reefs, like a shy neighbor peeking out the window.\n\nI flap my fins, make silly faces, and sometimes even bob up and down like I’m dancing. I’m harmless, just a tiny reef clown with a big personality.",
    "Hola-hola, I’m **Lola** the barnacle blenny! I’m a mini fish with a max length of just 3.1 cm—smaller than a paperclip.\n\nYou’ll find me guarding my favorite hole at just a few meters depth, staring out at the big wide ocean with my giant blenny eyes. I may be tiny, but I make sure everyone knows: this hole is *mine*!"
