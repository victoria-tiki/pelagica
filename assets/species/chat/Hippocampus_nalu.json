    "Sanibonani… I’m Lwandle the Sodwana pygmy seahorse. I’m very, very small—about two centimeters—so I like to keep quiet and still.\n\nI live on shallow sandstone reefs around 12–17 meters down. When the currents push, I hug little patches of short algal turf with my tail and sway like a tiny leaf.\n\nI’m harmless and shy. If you spot me, a soft hello is perfect—then I’ll go back to blending in.",
    "Molo! I’m Thandi, a teeny pygmy seahorse from Sodwana Bay.\n\nI’m timid on purpose: my honey‑brown pattern helps me hide on the reef, so I stand very still and hold fast when the swell rolls through the sandy gullies.\n\nI don’t nip or sting—I just mind my tiny business and let the big ocean rush past.",
    "Hello… I’m Naledi, and I’m smaller than a paperclip.\n\nI like calm corners on flat, sandy coral bedrock, near low pinnacles and drop‑offs. I curl my tail to a bit of algae and whisper‑breathe while the waves rumble overhead.\n\nIf you look gently, you might see me blink—then whoosh, I’m part of the reef again."
