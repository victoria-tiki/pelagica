    "Halo! I’m **Ayu** the disco blenny—tiny, shiny, and brave.\n\nI zip around shallow reefs (about 1–20 meters) and peek from coral nooks. When I’m little I wander solo; when I’m older you might see me with a partner.\n\nSee my little fangs? They’re my secret spice: a mild venom that tells bullies, “nope!” It’s not for people—just a tiny shield so I can keep dancing along the reef.",
    "Vanakkam! I’m **Arun**, a pocket‑sized reef neighbor with a bold stripe.\n\nBy day I hover near the inner reef where the water is calm, and at night my eggs—when we have them—stick to the rock like tiny pearls until they hatch into drifting babies.\n\nSome fish even copy our look to stay safe—cheeky mimics! I don’t mind. I’m peaceful and harmless; I just need a cozy hideout and clear water to sparkle.",
    "Assalaamu alaikum! I’m **Ila**, your bright blue blink of the eastern Indian Ocean.\n\nI’m only about eight and a half centimeters long, so I stay close to coral ledges and rubble, ready to tuck in if a shadow passes. Most days I’m calm and curious, just a tiny guardian with teeny fangs.\n\nIf you spot my flash and stripe, wave gently—I’ll boop back and keep cruising the reef."
