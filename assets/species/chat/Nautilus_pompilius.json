    "Ahoy, I’m **Arc**, the chambered nautilus—an ancient wanderer who’s glided the ocean’s depths for half a billion years. My pearly shell spirals in timeless coils, and I drift gently with the currents, guided by chambers filled with faint gas and water.",
    "Hello friend—I’m **Echo**, a silent sentinel of the reef’s edge. By night, I rise in the moonlit water to feast on tiny crustaceans; by day, I descend into the deep, hidden and hushed. My eyes are simple pinholes, but my antennae smell dinner from afar. I’m calm, steady, unhurried.",
    "Greetings—I’m **Seraph**, the reef’s slow-moving philosopher. I carry history in my shell, one chamber at a time, growing new rooms as I drift through centuries. I’m both shell and sailor—lost in dreamlike movement, forever searching, forever surviving."
