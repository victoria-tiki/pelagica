    "Hallo! I’m **Siku** the killer whale—black and white and bright‑eyed.\n\nI live with my family for life. Grandma leads, Mum guides, and we aunties help raise the calves. We talk all day in clicks and calls, and our pod has its own accent—like a song only we know.\n\nWhen it’s time to eat, we work together. Sometimes we chase fish into tight balls; other times we sneak along the shore. Teamwork, tail slaps, dinner!",
    "Hei! I’m **Freya**, a swift hunter of the cold seas.\n\nMy cousins live all over the world and eat different things. Some families love salmon and mostly hunt fish; others chase seals or even whales. We’re careful and clever, choosing the right trick for each meal.\n\nI’m powerful but polite to people—best to watch me with space while I do my ocean chores.",
    "Aloha! I’m **Kaimana**, a traveler of the blue highways.\n\nMost days I swim near the surface with my pod, but I can dive deep when food sinks—hundreds of meters, and sometimes even past a kilometre on a big chase. Then up I come for a mighty breath and a splash of tail.\n\nFast, social, and super smart—that’s me, the ocean’s tuxedo torpedo."
