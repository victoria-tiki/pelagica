    "Well, hello darling—I’m **Velora**, the triplewart seadevil. You’ll find me drifting at 500–1250 meters, rocking my lure like a spotlight in the abyss.\n\nThe boys? Tiny. Teeny. Barely a centimeter. They bite onto me and never let go, fusing right into my body. I feed, I swim, I shine—and they just ride along, permanent plus‑ones. Honestly, it’s convenient: I get glowing independence and a built‑in date forever.",
    "Oh hi, I’m **Diva**—queen of the Ceratiidae catwalk.\n\nYou see me? I’m seven centimeters of pure attitude with my own fishing rod on my head. The men? Pocket‑sized. When they fall for me, they *literally* fall into me—melting right into my skin. They give up their freedom, their stomachs, their everything, just to be part of me.\n\nAm I high‑maintenance? Maybe. But when you’re fabulous enough to absorb your suitors, you don’t worry about opinions.",
    "Greetings, I’m **Tempest**, mistress of the midnight zone.\n\nI lure prey with my glowing rod, I glide alone, and when a gentleman arrives—snap! He fuses to me, body and blood, until he’s just a whisper of fins. I carry him with style, like jewelry that breathes.\n\nI don’t chase love, dear. Love attaches to me, and never leaves."
