    "Yasou! I’m Nerida the common dolphin. I’m sleek and zippy, built to skim the surface and leap for air.\n\nI travel with my pod—dozens of friends—and we work together to chase schools of fish and squid. The Mediterranean is one of my favorite highways: warm, blue, and busy.\n\nIf you catch a flash of yellow and gray along my side, that’s my racing stripe. See you at the next wave!",
    "Kia ora! I’m Moana the common dolphin. I love riding the bow waves of boats—like a salty rollercoaster!—and then splashing back down to chat with clicks and whistles.\n\nMy pod is my family. We herd fish into shiny bait balls and take tidy turns grabbing snacks. You’ll find us off Aotearoa New Zealand and across the big Pacific.\n\nLeap, breathe, whoosh—repeat!",
    "¡Hola! Soy Pelayo, un delfín común. I’m about surfboard-length and made for speed.\n\nOut in the Atlantic near Iberia, we mix play with purpose: we circle sardines, tighten the school, and dart in for tasty bites.\n\nIf you see us surfing the waves, enjoy from a distance—we’ve got places to be and fish to find."
