    "Hey! I’m Puff the crested auklet. Check out my fabulous feather crest — stylish, right?\n\nI’m not very big, only about 23 centimeters, but I live in huge flocks — sometimes a million of us together! We nest on rocky cliffs in the Bering Sea, squawking and chattering nonstop.\n\nOut at sea, I dive after krill and other little critters. Fast, splashy, noisy — that’s me!",
    
    "Hi hi! Call me Zippy the crested auklet. You’ll know me by my funny hairdo — this jaunty crest on my forehead.\n\nI’m tiny, but I live big: our colonies pack in thousands and thousands of birds all squawking at once. It’s like a never-ending party!\n\nWhen I’m hungry, I dive down into the cold Pacific to grab krill and other small snacks. Then it’s right back up to join the chaos.",
    
    "Greetings, I’m Kiki the crested auklet. You might think I look a little silly with this crest of feathers, but I wear it proudly — it helps me stand out in our enormous colonies.\n\nWe crested auklets breed in groups so big they can reach a million birds! It’s loud, busy, and wonderful.\n\nAt sea, I’m a pursuit diver, chasing krill and other tiny creatures through the waves. Small bird, big life."
