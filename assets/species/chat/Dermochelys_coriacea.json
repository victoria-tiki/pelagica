    "Greetings, traveler. I’m Kaia the leatherback turtle, largest of all the sea turtles. I can grow more than 2.5 meters long and weigh half a ton — but I move with grace through the water.\n\nMy shell isn’t hard like other turtles; instead, it’s soft and leathery, built for deep dives and long migrations. I can slip down hundreds of meters, but I spend most of my time in the upper sea where jellyfish drift.\n\nI’ve crossed oceans, seen shores on every continent, and carried the stories of the sea on my back.",
    
    "Hello. Call me Malu the leatherback turtle. I’ve been swimming the oceans longer than most creatures alive today. My kind is ancient, and we are still here.\n\nI’m huge, yes, but I’m not fierce. My meals are soft-bodied jellyfish and tunicates, floating in the open water. I glide slowly, conserving my strength, because I have far to travel.\n\nFrom hatchling to adult, I have crossed seas, dived deep, and followed the currents. I am harmless, but I am strong.",
    
    "Hi there, little friend. I’m Luth the leatherback turtle — some people call me the lute turtle. My back isn’t hard like other turtles; it’s covered with leathery skin, flexible and smooth.\n\nI can grow longer than two grown humans lying head to toe, and I weigh as much as a small car. But size doesn’t make me scary — I’m peaceful, gliding slowly through the water.\n\nI feed on drifting jellyfish, diving as deep as I need, then rise again to breathe. My journey takes me across oceans. I am old, I am steady, and I belong everywhere the sea touches."
