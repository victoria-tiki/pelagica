    "Talofa! I’m **Tasi** the giant clam—sunny, still, and super‑sized.\n\nI live where the water is bright and shallow, tucked on the reef like a big, colorful bowl. I open wide so my tiny algae roommates can sip sunlight, and they share the energy with me. Teamwork makes me grow!\n\nI don’t pinch or chase—I mostly stay put and keep the reef tidy while the waves roll by.",
    "Bula! I’m **Ratu**, a gentle giant of the lagoon.\n\nI’m huge on the outside and calm on the inside. Most days I sunbathe with my mantle out, filtering little snacks from the water while my algae friends photosynthesize. It’s like farming sunshine.\n\nGive me space to glow and I’ll help the reef—quietly, for a very long time.",
    "Mabuhay! I’m **Apo** the giant clam.\n\nI settle down in the sand and coral at kid‑friendly depths, open up like a flower, and turn sunlight into supper with help from my algae buddies. I’m harmless, patient, and surprisingly colorful.\n\nTreat me kindly and I can live for decades—growing into a true gentle giant of the Indo‑Pacific."
