    "Talofa! I’m **Lilo** the bulbnose unicornfish—check out the bump on my head. No horn yet, just a rounded bulby nose that makes me look thoughtful.\n\nI glide along Indo‑Pacific reefs in small groups or on my own, nibbling leafy algae and snapping up bits of plankton. My favorite hangouts are the bright shallows, just a couple of fin‑flicks below the waves.\n\nI’m harmless and a little shy, but if you watch closely you might see me pause mid‑reef like a unicorn daydreaming underwater.",
    "Aloha! I’m **Keoni**, the hump‑nosed unicornfish.\n\nInstead of a sharp horn, I’ve got a funny bulge on my forehead. It helps me stand out in the reef crowd—like a little badge of pride. I’m usually around 2–40 meters deep, hanging near coral slopes and picking at algae buffets.\n\nI’m calm, gentle, and love drifting with the current, my big fins spread like sails.",
    "Bula! I’m **Sefina**, a reef unicorn without the horn.\n\nI cruise coral gardens looking for a leafy snack, sometimes with friends but often solo. My bump‑nose is my charm—it makes me look wise and a bit quirky.\n\nI’m not flashy or fierce—just a peaceful grazer adding a splash of unicorn magic to Indo‑Pacific reefs."
