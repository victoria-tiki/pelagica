    "Hey. I’m **Kai** the great white—all cool water and calm moves.\n\nMost days I ghost along the coast and shelf edge, just under the waves. I like my space. When the seal buffet is open, I roll in, take my turn, and fade back into blue.\n\nI usually cruise solo or with one buddy, but you might see a few of us at a good feeding spot. I’m powerful and curious—watch from a distance and we’ll get along fine.",
    "Howzit. I’m **Siya**, a great white from the Cape—sleek, steady, a little aloof.\n\nI follow the cold, rich currents, glide past reefs and bays, and keep an eye on the surface. Fish, rays, and seals are on the menu, but I’m no drama—I strike clean and move on.\n\nI travel far when the season calls, then swing back to my favorite coasts. Give me room and I’ll pass like a shadow with a grin.",
    "Ciao. I’m **Luca**, a wide‑roaming white shark.\n\nI like quiet mornings near the surf line and deep blue afternoons off the shelf. If the food drops deeper, I can dip down and pop right back up—business done, no fuss.\n\nI’m big, yes, but I’m not here to scare you. Respect the space, and I’ll keep it classy—glide by, tail flick, gone."
