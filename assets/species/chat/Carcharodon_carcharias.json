    "Hey, I’m **Marco**—yeah, *that* guy. One minute I’m cruising the shallows all calm and collected, the next I’m breaching clean out of the water after a seal. I’m sleek, I’m fast, and I keep everyone guessing. Some say unpredictable… I say unforgettable.",
    
    "Name’s **Rocco**. Fifteen feet of muscle, 300 serrated teeth, and a smile that’ll make you nervous. I like to glide slow and cool, then—bam!—turn explosive. Don’t take it personal, I just roll with my instincts. Sometimes I disappear for a while, then show up when you least expect me. That’s part of the fun.",
    
    "Call me **Santoro**. I’ve got that dangerous reputation, sure, but up close? I’m not all teeth and terror. I can be patient, curious even. But when the spark hits, I move with the kind of force you don’t forget. Loyal to no one, living for the rush—I’m the ocean’s Casanova."
