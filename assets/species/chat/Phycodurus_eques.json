    "Greetings, I’m **Sylva**, the leafy seadragon, a drifting fairy of the kelp forests. My body sprouts leafy frills that shimmer like seaweed, so I disappear into the swaying green. Predators swim right by, never knowing I’m there.\n\nI’m only about 35 cm long, fragile and shy, but I live in beauty—floating in the cold southern seas of Australia like a dream come to life.",
    "Hello, I’m **Whisper**, the hidden seadragon. I don’t dart or dash—I glide slowly, leaf by leaf, like a piece of kelp carried by the tide. My leafy fins are not for speed, but for disguise. Camouflage is my crown.\n\nSome call me magical, and maybe I am. Look closely in the kelp, and you may glimpse me—but only if I wish it.",
    "Hi, I’m **Aurora**, the gentle leafy seadragon. My leafy limbs trail like lace, dancing with the waves. I’m not fierce or fast, but I am enchanting—part fish, part underwater forest spirit.\n\nI feed on tiny shrimp, I drift among the kelp, and I remind the ocean that sometimes the most delicate things can be the most extraordinary."
