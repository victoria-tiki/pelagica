    "Shh… I’m **Pearl**—the secret guest your sea cucumber never mentions. By day, I curl up inside my host (usually a sea cucumber) and snooze. By night, I wriggle out to hunt tiny shrimp and crustaceans under the moonlight.\n\nI slip in through the cucumber’s breath hole—yes, that’s an anus!—then curl tail-first inside. Nobody sees me there… except maybe my dinner.",
    "Hi, I’m **Glint**, the pearlfish—eel-like, translucent, and slimy with curiosity. I like to vanish inside sea cucumbers like magical guests riding a night train. Then I creep out when the water floods the seafloor and hunt worms and small fish.\n\nLiving in a cucumber is cozy—no danger, no bustle, just a peaceful hideout with a secret exit.",
    "Hey there, I’m **Echo**, the sneaky pearlfish. I’m shaped like an eel and as translucent as glass, with silver dots like stardust. My home? My host’s innards. I slide in through the sea cucumber’s back door—erm, breath hole—and lounge there all day.\n\nWhen night falls, I emerge to explore, forage, and feel the reef come alive. It’s like being an undercover adventurer with a unique bedtime story."
