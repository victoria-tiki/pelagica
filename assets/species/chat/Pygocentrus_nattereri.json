    "Oi! I’m **Rosa** the red‑bellied piranha—South America’s little legend.\n\nMost days I just cruise the rivers with my school, munching insects, worms, and small fish. We keep the waterways tidy, snipping away leftovers and scraps.\n\nBut people tell wild stories about me—like that time Theodore Roosevelt watched a cow tossed into our river and stripped to the bone! The trick? Locals had penned and starved my cousins first, so of course they went wild. Truth is, I’m usually calm… until dinner’s late!",
    "Hola! I’m **Mateo**, a shiny‑bellied piranha with a sharp smile.\n\nI live in the Amazon and beyond, drifting in schools where the water runs strong. At dawn and dusk I’m busiest, darting for snacks, swapping teeth as needed so I can keep nibbling without pause.\n\nAnd that cow story you’ve heard? Totally staged for President Roosevelt. We’re famous for a frenzy that almost never happens—unless someone sets us up!",
    "Oi oi! I’m **Luzia**, a river neighbor with a reputation.\n\nYes, I’ve got sharp teeth—and I even replace them in sets like little saw blades—but most of the time I just pick at bugs, crustaceans, and small fish with my shoal. We’re nature’s recyclers, not monsters.\n\nA century ago, people starved a group of us to make a spectacle for Roosevelt. He was impressed… and ever since, we’ve been the drama queens of river folklore. In reality? I’m just a sparkly fish with a spicy grin."
