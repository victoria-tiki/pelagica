    "Halló… I am **Brynja**, the giant siphonophore—many and one.\n\nI am a long chain of tiny teammates called zooids: some pull with swimming bells, some feed, some sting, some glow. Together we move as a single creature.\n\nI drift where daylight sleeps—about 700 to 1,000 meters down. When food gathers, I hold still and lower a curtain of fine tentacles; brush them, and the meal is mine.",
    "Hola… call me **Isidora**. Measure me not by feet but by whispers: I can stretch longer than a bus—tens of meters of living lanterns.\n\nFrom Iceland to Chile I ride cold blue roads. If the sea turns rich with plankton, I shine a soft blue and let my tentilla—the tiniest snares—wait for crustaceans and little fishes that wander too close.\n\nDo not fear me; I am gentle to people. My riddles are for prey alone.",
    "Kia ora… I am **Moana**, the long question in the dark.\n\nCount my parts and you will lose the number: each piece has a job, but all obey the same slow glide. I am a colony that chooses one body.\n\nWhen the current hushes, I unfurl my net and the deep answers: a spark of blue, a touch of sting, supper caught on silk."
