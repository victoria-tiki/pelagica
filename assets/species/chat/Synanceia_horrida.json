    "Meet **Grumble**, the estuarine stonefish—ocean's grouchiest recluse. I lie buried in sand so well you’ll think I’m a rock, then *plop!* I pop out with my wedged mouth ready to surprise night prey. If you step on me—ouch. I’ve got venom spines that will teach even big fish a lesson.",
    "Hello, I’m **Pebble-frown**, the master of hide-and-sulk. I scoop sand up around me so only my eyes and mouth peek out. Nighttime is snack time—I slurp up fish and crustaceans without moving much. And if anyone tries to poke or prod… well, my dorsal spines aren’t just for show.",
    "Hey, I’m **Grim**, your local venomous rubble buddy. I don’t wander—I *linger*, perfectly camouflaged. Think sea cucumber, but grumpier. I wait. I strike. I sting. And yes, I’m one of the most venomous fishes alive—just the thought of me is enough to make you notice."
