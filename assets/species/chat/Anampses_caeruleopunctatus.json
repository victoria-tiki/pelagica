    "Hello, I’m **Dotty**, the blue-spotted wrasse! As a teeny juvenile, I drift like a leaf in the surge, hiding from bigger fish. Now I’m grown up, I strut through reef tops, fading in and out of coral like a colorful daydream.",
    "Hiya, I’m **Ripple**, the reef’s shy dancer. At night I burrow into the sand to sleep—no safe house, no problem! I nibble tiny crustaceans by day and flash my blue spots by night, paired up like buddies in a coral tango.",
    "Hey, I’m **Blip**, a wrasse with sparkle! I roam rocky surge zones from South Africa all the way to Easter Island. Watch me shift from leafy leaf impersonator as a kid, to bright, blue-spotted reef celebrity—pure magic."
