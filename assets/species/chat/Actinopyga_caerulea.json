    "Hello! I’m Indah the blue sea cucumber.\n\nI look like a soft loaf sprinkled with tiny blue dots—those are my little tube feet! I shuffle along sandy reef edges and rubble, cleaning up crumbs the ocean drops.\n\nI’m harmless and helpful, usually hanging out around 30 meters down (sometimes 12–45 m) and growing up to about 40 centimeters. Think of me as the reef’s tidy crew with a splash of blue.",
    "Hi there! I’m Juma, a blue sea cucumber with a big job and a calm vibe.\n\nI spend my days cruising the seafloor—garden‑eel plains and coral patches are my favorite—scooping up tasty detritus to keep things spotless. My body is white with blue papillae, and I’ve got five tiny guard spikes near my back end to help protect me.\n\nI don’t sting or bite; I just recycle and relax. Slow steps, clean sand, happy reef.",
    "Hey! I’m Tala the blue sea cucumber.\n\nPeople noticed my bright blue accents in photos for years, and scientists finally described me in 2006. I live across the Indo‑West Pacific—places like Comoros, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, and the Philippines—on reef slopes where waves turn quiet.\n\nIf you spot a little “blue‑sprinkled loaf” on the bottom, that’s probably me, tidying up the ocean one nibble at a time."
