    "Hi! I’m **Nerina** the European anchovy—small, shiny, and always on the move.\n\nI zip through the top layers of the sea with my huge school, turning all at once like a glittery cloud. We snack on teeny plankton—just open wide and zoom!\n\nIn warm months we skim near the surface, and when it gets chilly we drift deeper. I’m tiny (about the length of a pencil), totally harmless, and full of energy.",
    "Hello! I’m **Deniz**, a speedy little anchovy from the Mediterranean.\n\nMy friends and I travel in giant teams so we can swirl, split, and swirl again—safety in numbers and super fun to watch. Plankton is our popcorn, and we chase it wherever the currents carry it.\n\nSometimes our eggs float near the sunlit top and hatch quickly, so the babies can join the party. We’re small but mighty—and very busy!",
    "Hey there! I’m **Ines** the anchovy.\n\nI live where sunlight sparkles on the waves, but I can cruise down deeper when winter comes. My school and I move like one big dancer, dodging bigger fish and scooping up clouds of plankton as we go.\n\nI won’t bite or sting—promise. I’m a harmless little flash of silver with a big, high‑energy heart."
