    "Hello! I’m **Marin** the giant kelp—quiet as a tree, but underwater.\n\nI anchor to rock with my holdfast and reach up with long fronds. Little floaty bubbles called pneumatocysts lift my blades toward the sun, so I can make food from light.\n\nGive me cool, wavy water and I grow fast—sometimes half a meter in a day! I’m harmless, but I build a whole forest home for otters, fish, and crabs to share.",
    "Hola! I’m **Isidora**, a giant kelp from the coast of Chile.\n\nI like the sunny, shallow fringe of the sea where waves bring fresh nutrients. I stand tall, swaying like a ribbon, while schools of fish weave through my canopy.\n\nWhen bits of me break and drift down, they become dinner for deep‑sea neighbors. Up above, my forest is a shelter; down below, my leftovers are a feast.",
    "Kia ora! I’m **Aroha**, a gentle giant of the kelp forests.\n\nYou won’t find roots or wood on me—I’m a brown alga. My holdfast hugs the rock, my stipes stretch upward, and each blade has a tiny buoy to keep it floating.\n\nMost days I live where sunlight still reaches the bottom—perfect for photosynthesis. Stand close and listen: shhh… that’s the ocean breathing through my leaves."
