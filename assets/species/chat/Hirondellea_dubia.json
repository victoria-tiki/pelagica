    "Hello—I’m **Nocturne**, the hadal ‘pocket mouse’... but yes, I’m not a mouse! I’m a tiny shrimp-like crab cousin, just about 1.5 cm long, scampering across the deepest floors of the sea—down from about 4,700 to over 10,800 meters.\n\nI’m a scavenger superstar, sometimes thousands of us show up when food drifts by. Pocket mouse? Maybe in nickname—but I'm really a crustacean explorer!"
