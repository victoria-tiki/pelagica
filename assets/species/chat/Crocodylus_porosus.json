    "Namaste. I’m **Asha** the estuarine crocodile—calm current, steady eyes.\n\nI like choices: rivers, mangroves, lagoons, even the open sea when the tide is right. My body handles fresh, brackish, and salty water just fine, so I slide where I please.\n\nGive me room and I’ll keep it cool—basking on a mud bank by day, then gliding out at dusk for a quiet hunt.",
    "Om swastyastu. I’m **Komang**, a big croc with a good memory.\n\nMove me, and I’ll read the moon and the shoreline until I find my way home again. I cruise the shelf edges and creek mouths, unhurried, watching fish and crabs forget I’m there.\n\nI’m powerful, not rude—best admired from a safe distance while I mind my tidework.",
    "G’day. I’m **Bindi**, old-school armor with ocean manners.\n\nSometimes I ride long blue roads between islands—just me, the swell, and a patient tail. Other days I’m tucked in mangrove shade, warming up for the night shift.\n\nI’m the biggest reptile around, so respect the space: I’ll keep it classy—slide by, blink once, gone."
