    "Halò! I’m **Hamish** the southern elephant seal—big nose, bigger voice.\n\nOn land I flop on wide, sandy beaches with my loud, snorty friends. Out at sea I’m quiet as a shadow, diving for long, deep looks where the light fades. Squid and fish are my favorite snacks.\n\nI’m huge but gentle to people. Give me room for a nap, and I’ll dream of the deep before my next long breath.",
    "Bonjour! I’m **Élodie**, a southern elephant seal from the far islands.\n\nMost of the year I’m at sea, gliding down and up, down and up, tasting the cold water for squid. Then I haul out to rest and raise a pup on a busy beach—lots of neighbors, lots of noise!\n\nI can stay under for a very long time, then pop up for a quick gulp of air and slip back into the blue.",
    "G’day! I’m **Matilda**, a deep‑diving beach potato with flippers.\n\nI love a good mud wallow and a sunny snooze, but don’t be fooled—I’m an athlete in the water. I take long dives, steer with my back flippers, and follow silvery fish through the dim places.\n\nSometimes scientists give me a tiny hat (a tag!) so I can share ocean secrets. I don’t mind—I’m a polite giant."
