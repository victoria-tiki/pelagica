    "Hey there! I’m Lilo the common parrotfish. Check out my smile — my teeth are fused into a beak, just like a parrot’s! I use it to scrape tasty algae right off the corals.\n\nI’m about 40 centimeters long, and I spend my days cruising reef flats and lagoons with my buddies, nibbling, crunching, and keeping the reef clean.\n\nAt night, I blow myself a special snotty sleeping bag — a mucus cocoon — so predators can’t smell me. Gross? Maybe. Effective? Totally!",
    
    "Hi hi! Call me Moana the parrotfish. I’m bright, I’m busy, and I’ve got the best teeth in the reef.\n\nYou’ll see me over corals in the Indo-Pacific, chomping away at algae all day. Sometimes I join a little school of parrotfish — we snack together like a moving lawnmower.\n\nAt night, I tuck myself into a gooey bubble of mucus. Weird, huh? But it keeps me safe till morning.",
    
    "Hello, I’m Tiko the parrotfish. My job? Keeping reefs healthy! I graze on algae that would otherwise smother the corals.\n\nI can grow to about 43 centimeters, but don’t worry — I’m totally harmless. Well, except if someone tries to eat me — sometimes my flesh can carry ciguatera, a nasty toxin.\n\nOtherwise, I’m just a colorful reef resident with a funny beak and a love for munching algae."
