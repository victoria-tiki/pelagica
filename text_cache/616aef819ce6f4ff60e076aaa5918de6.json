  "summary": "The Palau nautilus is a nautiloid mainly found off of Palau in the Western Carolines. It can be found on fore reef slopes, at depths of 95m-504m (311'-1,653'), though typically preferring a range of 150m-300m (492'-984'), where water temperatures stay around 16.6 \u00b0C (61.88\u00b0F) and do not go much lower than 9.4\u00a0\u00b0C (48.92\u00b0F). N. belauensis are highly mobile, epibenthic scavengers and opportunistic predators which rely mostly on scent for finding food.",
