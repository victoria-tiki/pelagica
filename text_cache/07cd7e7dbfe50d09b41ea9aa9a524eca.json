  "summary": "The staghorn coral is a branching, stony coral, within the Order Scleractinia. It is characterized by thick, upright branches which can grow in excess of 2 meters (6.5\u00a0ft) in height and resemble the antlers of a stag, hence the name, Staghorn. It grows within various areas of a reef but is most commonly found within shallow fore and back reefs, as well as patch reefs, where water depths rarely exceed 20 meters (65\u00a0ft). Staghorn corals can exhibit very fast growth, adding up to 5\u00a0cm in new skeleton for every 1\u00a0cm of existing skeleton each year, making them one of the fastest growing fringe coral species in the Western Atlantic.",
