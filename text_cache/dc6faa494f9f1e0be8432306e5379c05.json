  "summary": "Stejneger's beaked whale, also known as the Bering Sea beaked whale or the saber-toothed whale, is a relatively unknown member of the genus Mesoplodon inhabiting the North Pacific Ocean. Leonhard Hess Stejneger collected the type specimen on Bering Island in 1883, from which Frederick W. True provided the species' description in 1885. In 1904, the first complete skull was collected, which confirmed the species' validity.",
