It is commonly found in northern waters all around the world including both the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans to a northerly latitude of 81 degrees and as far south as Maine and England. The average adult size is around 50\u00a0mm (2\u00a0in), but it has been recorded at a diameter of 87\u00a0mm (3.4\u00a0in).
