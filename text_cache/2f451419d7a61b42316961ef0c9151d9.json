  "summary": "The shortnose spurdog also known as the piked spurdog is a small shark located primarily off the coast of Southern Australia and South Africa. The shortnose spurdog's size is dependent on the sex of the animal. The female shortnose spurdog is consistently larger than the male shortnose spurdog and will typically measure out to about 56.41\u00a0cm (1.85\u00a0ft) while the male shortnose spurdog will typically only measure out to about 44.36\u00a0cm in length (1.46\u00a0ft) which means the female shortnose spurdog is over 10\u00a0cm longer than the male shortnose spurdog. Some females can even measure up to 78\u00a0cm which is over 2.5 feet long.",
