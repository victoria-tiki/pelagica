  "summary": "Cuvier's beaked whale, goose-beaked whale, or ziphius is the most widely distributed of all beaked whales in the family Ziphiidae. It is smaller than most baleen whales\u2014and indeed the larger toothed cetaceans \u2014yet it is large among the beaked whales and smaller cetaceans, appearing somewhat like a bigger and stockier bottlenose dolphin. Cuvier's beaked whale is pelagic, generally inhabiting waters deeper than 300\u00a0m (1,000\u00a0ft), though it has been observed closer to shore on occasion. In these offshore waters, Cuvier's beaked whales execute some of the deepest and longest recorded dives among whales, and extant mammals.",
