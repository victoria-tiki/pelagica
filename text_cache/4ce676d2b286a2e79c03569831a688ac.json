  "summary": "The three-spined stickleback is a fish native to most inland and coastal waters north of 30\u00b0N. It has long been a subject of scientific study for many reasons. It shows great morphological variation throughout its range, ideal for questions about evolution and population genetics. Many populations are anadromous and very tolerant of changes in salinity, a subject of interest to physiologists.",
