  "summary": "Nanomia bijuga is a species of siphonophores in the family Agalmatidae, a colonial organism like other siphonophores, which possess specialized zooids such as the jet-propulsive nectophores. They can be found in coastal and open-ocean environments in the North Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, occupying the epipelagic and the mesopelagic zones of the ocean. N. bijuga participates in the Diel Vertical Migration, moving up to the epipelagic zone to feed on plankton at night and then back down to the mesopelagic zone during the day..",
