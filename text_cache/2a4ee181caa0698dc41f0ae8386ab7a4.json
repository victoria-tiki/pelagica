  "summary": "The bluespotted ribbontail ray is a species of stingray in the family Dasyatidae. Found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 30\u00a0m (100\u00a0ft), this species is common throughout the tropical Indian and western Pacific Oceans in nearshore, coral reef\u2013associated habitats. It is a fairly small ray, not exceeding 35\u00a0cm (14\u00a0in) in width, with a mostly smooth, oval pectoral fin disc, large protruding eyes, and a relatively short and thick tail with a deep fin fold underneath. It can be easily identified by its striking color pattern of many electric blue spots on a yellowish background, with a pair of blue stripes on the tail..",
