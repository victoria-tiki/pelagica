  "summary": "The sablefish is one of two members of the fish family Anoplopomatidae and the only species in the genus Anoplopoma. In English, common names for it include sable (US), butterfish (US), black cod, blue cod (UK), bluefish (UK), candlefish (UK), coal cod (UK), snowfish, coalfish (Canada), beshow, and skil (Canada), although many of these names also refer to other, unrelated, species. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration accepts only \"sablefish\" as the acceptable market name in the United States; \"black cod\" is considered a vernacular (regional) name and should not be used as a statement of identity for this species.",
