  "summary": "The Atlantic sixgill shark is a rare species of hexanchid shark found in the Atlantic Ocean at depths that are greater than 300 meters. These depths are known as mesopelagic and bathypelagic in tropical and temperate waters around the world. The Atlantic sixgill shark is very similar to other species of sixgill in terms of its growth rate in deep sea waters. It is believed that this is due to the abiotic and biotic factors in relation to the depths at which they are found.",
