  "summary": "Alviniconcha is a genus of deep water sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Paskentanidae. These snails are part of the fauna of the hydrothermal vents in the Indian and Western Pacific Ocean. These and another genus and species within the same family are the only known currently existing animals whose nutrition is derived from an endosymbiotic relationship with a member of bacteria from phylum Campylobacterota and Gammaproteobacteria, occurring as endosymbionts within the vacuoles of Alviniconcha ctenidia. All species of Alviniconcha are thought to be foundational species found near hydrothermal venting fluid supplying their bacterial endosymbionts with vent derived compounds such as hydrogen sulfide.",
