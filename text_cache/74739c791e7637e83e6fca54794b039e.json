  "summary": "Cirrothauma murrayi, the blind cirrate octopus, is a presumably blind octopus whose eyes can likely sense light, but not form images. It has been found worldwide, usually 1,500 to 4,500 metres beneath the ocean's surface, but a single specimen was collected in the Arctic immediately below the sea ice. Like other cirrates, it has an internal shell, muscular fins for swimming, and a web connecting the arms..",
