  "summary": "Justitia mauritiana is a species of spiny lobster, sometimes called the gibbon furrow lobster. It lives in the western Indian Ocean around the Mascarene Islands, and also around the Hawaiian Islands. Larvae supposed to belong to this species have been reported around the Philippines, the Gilbert Islands and Tahiti. It grows to a total body length of 16 centimetres (6.3\u00a0in), and this small size, together with its scarcity and the difficulties of fishing for lobsters on rocky substrates, means that the species is not commercially exploited.",
