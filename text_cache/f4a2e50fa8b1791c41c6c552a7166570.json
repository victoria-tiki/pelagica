  "summary": "Thetys vagina, or the twin-sailed salp, is the largest known solitary species of salp and the only valid species of the genus Thetys.\u00a0First described by W.G Tilesius\u00a0in 1802, the species is transparent and gelatinous, making it difficult to be seen in water, which is helpful in avoiding predators. The fossil range is very recent. Other animals often mistaken for T. vagina are Salpa fusiformis, Aurelia aurita, and Pegea confoederata.",
