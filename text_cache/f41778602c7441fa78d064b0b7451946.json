  "summary": "The freshwater crocodile, also known commonly as the Australian freshwater crocodile, Johnstone's crocodile, and the freshie, is a species of crocodile native to the northern regions of Australia. Unlike its much larger Australian relative, the saltwater crocodile, the freshwater crocodile is not known as a man-eater, although it bites in self-defence, and brief, nonfatal attacks have occurred, apparently the result of mistaken identity..",
