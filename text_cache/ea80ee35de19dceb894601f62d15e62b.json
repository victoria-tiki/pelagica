  "summary": "Idiacanthus atlanticus, the black dragonfish, is a barbeled dragonfish of the family Stomiidae, found circumglobally in southern subtropical and temperate oceans between latitudes 25\u00b0S and 60\u00b0S, at depths down to 2,000 metres (6,600\u00a0ft). The species is sexually dimorphic: females are black with six stripes; males are brown, and lack the females' canine teeth, pelvic fins and barbel. They can weigh between 13\u201315 grams. Females are believed to make a diel vertical migration from deeper than 500 metres (1,600\u00a0ft) by day to surface waters at night, whereas males do not migrate, remaining below 1,000 metres (3,300\u00a0ft) at all times..",
