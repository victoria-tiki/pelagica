  "summary": "Abraliopsis gilchristi is a species of enoploteuthid cephalopod found in southern temperate waters of the south Pacific Ocean, from New Zealand to South Africa, where it is abundant. It undergoes a vertical daily migration, spending the day at depth and moving closer to the surface at night to feed on copepods, euphausiids and hyperiids. Spawning appears to occur between September and December. It was first described in 1924 as Abralia gilchristi by Guy Coburn Robson.",
