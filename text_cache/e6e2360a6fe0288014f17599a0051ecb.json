  "summary": "Canthigaster solandri, commonly known as the spotted sharpnose puffer, is a ray-finned species of fish in the pufferfish family. It grows to a length of 11.5 centimeters in total length. It lives in the tropical Indo-Pacific: from East Africa to the Line Islands and the Tuamotus, north to the Ryukyu Islands, south to New Caledonia and Tonga, to the Hawaiian Islands. This species, like other members of the family Tetraodontidae, demonstrates the ability to rapidly fill itself up like a water balloon, to protect itself from predators.",
