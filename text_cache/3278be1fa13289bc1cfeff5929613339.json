  "summary": "The megamouth shark is a species of deepwater shark. Rarely seen by humans, it measures around 13\u201318\u00a0ft (4\u20135.5\u00a0m) long and is the smallest of the three extant filter-feeding sharks alongside the much larger whale shark and basking shark. According to Sharkman's World Organization, a total of 296 specimens have been observed or caught since its discovery in 1976. Like the other two planktivorous sharks, it swims with its mouth wide open, filtering water for plankton and jellyfish.",
