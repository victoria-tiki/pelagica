It is the largest species of bony fish in the Southern Ocean, feeding largely on smaller fishes and crustaceans, and, in turn, preyed on by orcas, other toothed whales, and seals. It is caught for food and marketed as Chilean sea bass together with its sister species, the more northerly Patagonian toothfish.
