  "summary": "The pelican eel is a deep-sea eel. It is the only known member of the genus Eurypharynx and the family Eurypharyngidae. The species belongs to the \"saccopharyngiforms\", members of which were historically placed in their own order, but are now considered true eels in the order Anguilliformes. The pelican eel has been described by many synonyms, yet nobody has been able to demonstrate that more than one species of pelican eel exists.",
