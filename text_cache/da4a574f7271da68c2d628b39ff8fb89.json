  "summary": "Pseudoliparis swirei, the Mariana snailfish or Mariana hadal snailfish, is a species of snailfish found at hadal depths in the Mariana Trench in the western Pacific Ocean. It is known from a depth range of 6,198\u20138,076\u00a0m (20,335\u201326,496\u00a0ft), including a capture at 7,966\u00a0m (26,135\u00a0ft), which is possibly the record for a fish caught on the seafloor. Various anatomical, physiological, molecular and genetic adaptions help this species survive in such depths..",
