  "summary": "The giant squid is a species of deep-ocean dwelling squid in the family Architeuthidae. It can grow to a tremendous size, offering an example of abyssal gigantism: recent estimates put the maximum body size at around 5\u00a0m (16\u00a0ft) for females, with males slightly shorter, from the posterior fins to the tip of its long arms. This makes it longer than the colossal squid at an estimated 4.2\u00a0m (14\u00a0ft), but substantially lighter, as it is less robust and its arms make up much of the length. The mantle of the giant squid is about 2\u00a0m long, and the feeding tentacles of the giant squid, concealed in life, are 10\u00a0m (33\u00a0ft).",
