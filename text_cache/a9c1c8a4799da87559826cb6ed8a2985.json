  "summary": "The bullneck seahorse is a pygmy seahorse in the genus Hippocampus. This seahorse has never been found in the wild, and little is known about its natural habitat. The only known specimens were collected on the coast of Eden, Australia. It is thought to live in sand beds at the bottom of the ocean, \"64 - 100 meters below sea level\" possibly wrapping its prehensile tail around gorgonian corals.",
