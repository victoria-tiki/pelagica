  "summary": "Ciona intestinalis is an ascidian, a tunicate with very soft tunic. Its Latin name literally means \"pillar of intestines\", referring to the fact that its body is a soft, translucent column-like structure, resembling a mass of intestines sprouting from a rock. It is a globally distributed cosmopolitan species. Since Linnaeus described the species, Ciona intestinalis has been used as a model invertebrate chordate in developmental biology and genomics.",
