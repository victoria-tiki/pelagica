  "summary": "Costasiella ocellifera is a small (5\u201313\u00a0mm) species of sea slug, a shell-less marine gastropod mollusk in the family Costasiellidae. Costasiella ocellifera, and other members of the family Costasiellidae are often mistakenly classified as nudibranchs because they superficially resemble other species of that group, but they are actually a part of the Sacoglossa superorder of sea slugs, also known as the \"sap-sucking sea slugs\", \"crawling leaves\" or the \"solar-powered sea slugs\". C. ocellifera was discovered by Simroth in 1895, and was initially classified as Doto ocellifera.",
