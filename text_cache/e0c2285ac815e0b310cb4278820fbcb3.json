  "summary": "The pineapplefish also known as the Mailfish is a species of fish in the family Monocentridae, and the sole member of the genus Cleidopus. It is also known as the knightfish or the coat-of-mail fish, due to the armor-like scales covering its body, and the port-and-starboard light fish, as it has a pair of bioluminescent organs that are reminiscent of navigation lights on ships. Its specific epithet is from the Latin gloria and maris, meaning \"glory of the sea\"..",
