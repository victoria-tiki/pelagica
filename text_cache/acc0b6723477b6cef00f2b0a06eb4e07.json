  "summary": "Mola tecta, the hoodwinker sunfish, belongs to the family Molidae and genus Mola. It is closely related to the more widely known ocean sunfish. The Latin word \"tecta\" means hidden. The word \"hidden\" was adopted for the name because the fish has blended in among other species of sunfish for a long time and has only been discovered recently.",
