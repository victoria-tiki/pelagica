  "summary": "The marine iguana, also known as the sea iguana, saltwater iguana, or Gal\u00e1pagos marine iguana, is a species of iguana found only on the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands (Ecuador). Unique among modern lizards, it is a marine reptile that has the ability to forage in the sea for algae, which make up almost all of its diet. Marine iguanas are the only extant lizard that spends time in a marine environment. Large males are able to dive to find this food source, while females and smaller males feed during low tide in the intertidal zone.",
