  "summary": "The leopard shark is a species of houndshark, in the family Triakidae. It is found along the Pacific coast of North America, from the U.S. state of Oregon to Mazatl\u00e1n in Mexico. Typically measuring 1.2\u20131.5\u00a0m (3.9\u20134.9\u00a0ft) long, this slender-bodied shark is immediately identifiable by the striking pattern of black saddle-like markings and large spots over its back, from which it derives its common name.",
