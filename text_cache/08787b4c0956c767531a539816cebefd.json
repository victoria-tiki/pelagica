  "summary": "The striped stingaree is a common but little-known species of stingray in the family Urolophidae, endemic to shallow, inshore waters off southwestern Australia. Reaching 61\u00a0cm (24\u00a0in) long, this species is characterized by an oval, grayish to brownish disc with darker mask-like markings around the eyes and paired blotches at the center of the disc that are extended posteriorly into horizontal lines. Its nostrils have enlarged lobes on the outer margins and a skirt-shaped curtain of skin with a deeply fringed trailing margin in between. Its tail terminates in a relatively large leaf-shaped caudal fin, and bears a small dorsal fin just before the stinging spine.",
