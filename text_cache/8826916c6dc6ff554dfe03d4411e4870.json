  "summary": "The Pacific spiny dogfish is a common species of the Squalidae (dogfish) family of sharks and are among the most abundant species of sharks in the world. This species is closely related to the Spiny dogfish and for many years they were treated as a single species. Recent research, using meristic, morphological and molecular data led to the resurrection of the Pacific spiny dogfish as a separate species. The American Fisheries Society recommends the common name \"Pacific spiny dogfish\" for Squalus suckleyi over alternatives such as \"spotted spiny dogfish\" and \"North Pacific spiny dogfish\" and \"spiny dogfish\" for Squalus acanthias..",
