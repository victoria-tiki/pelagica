  "summary": "Riftia pachyptila is a marine invertebrate in the phylum of segmented worms, Annelida, which include the other \"polychaete\" tube worms commonly found in shallow water marine environments and coral reefs. R. pachyptila lives in the deep sea, growing on geologically active regions of the Pacific Ocean's seafloor, such as near hydrothermal vents. These vents provide a natural ambient temperature ranging from 2 to 30 degrees Celsius, and emit large amounts of chemicals such as hydrogen sulfide, which this species can tolerate at extremely high levels.",
