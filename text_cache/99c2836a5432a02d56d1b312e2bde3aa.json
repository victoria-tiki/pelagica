  "summary": "Chrysomallon squamiferum, commonly known as the scaly-foot gastropod, scaly-foot snail, sea pangolin, or volcano snail, is a species of deep-sea hydrothermal-vent snail, a marine gastropod mollusc in the family Peltospiridae. This vent-endemic gastropod is known only from deep-sea hydrothermal vents in the Indian Ocean, where it has been found at depths of about 2,400\u20132,900\u00a0m (1.5\u20131.8\u00a0mi). C. squamiferum differs greatly from other deep-sea gastropods, even the closely related neomphalines.",
