  "summary": "Phronima sedentaria is a species of amphipod crustaceans found in oceans at a depth of up to 1\u00a0km (0.6\u00a0mi). They are large in size relative to other members of the family Phronimidae. Individuals may be found inside barrel-like homes, created most commonly from the tunics of select species of pelagic tunicates; Phronima females appropriate these tunics and rear their young within.
