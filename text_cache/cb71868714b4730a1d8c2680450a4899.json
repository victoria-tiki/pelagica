  "summary": "The red-lipped batfish or Gal\u00e1pagos batfish is a fish of unusual morphology found around the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and off Ecuador at depths of 3 to 76\u00a0m. Red-lipped batfish are closely related to rosy-lipped batfish, which are found near Cocos Island off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica. This fish is mainly known for its bright red lips. Batfish are not good swimmers; they use their highly adapted pectoral, pelvic and anal fins to \"walk\" on the ocean floor.",
