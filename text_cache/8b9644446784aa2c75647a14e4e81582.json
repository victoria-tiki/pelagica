  "summary": "Corynactis californica is a brightly colored colonial anthozoan corallimorph. Unlike the Atlantic true sea anemone, Actinia fragacea, that bears the same common name, strawberry anemone, this species is a member of the order Corallimorpharia, and is the only member found on the west coast of North America. Other common names include club-tipped anemone and strawberry corallimorpharian. The anemone can live up to at least 50 meters (164\u00a0ft) deep on vertical rock walls, and at the bottom of kelp forests.",
