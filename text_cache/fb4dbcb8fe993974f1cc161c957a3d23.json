  "summary": "The common thresher, also known as Atlantic thresher, is the largest species of thresher shark, family Alopiidae, reaching some 6\u00a0m (20\u00a0ft) in length. About half of its length consists of the elongated upper lobe of its caudal fin. With a streamlined body, short pointed snout, and modestly sized eyes, the common thresher resembles the pelagic thresher. It can be distinguished from the latter species by the white of its belly extending in a band over the bases of its pectoral fins.",
