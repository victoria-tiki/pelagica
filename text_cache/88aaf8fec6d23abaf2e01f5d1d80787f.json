  "summary": "The bigeye chimaera is a species of fish in the family Chimaeridae. It is found in Chile and possibly Ecuador. Its natural habitat is open seas. It is only known from the preabyssal zone off Valparaiso, and may occur as far south as Valdivia and as far north as the Gal\u00e1pagos Islands and Nicaragua and Guatemala, so may be more widespread, but species research is not abundant..",
