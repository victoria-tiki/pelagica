  "summary": "Commerson's dolphin, also referred to by the common names jacobita, skunk dolphin, piebald dolphin, panda dolphin, or tonina overa, is a small oceanic dolphin of the genus Cephalorhynchus. Commerson's dolphin has two geographically isolated but locally common subspecies. The principal subspecies, C.c.commersonii, has sharply-delineated black-and-white patterning and is found around the tip of South America. The secondary subspecies, C.c.kerguelenensis, is larger than C.c.commersonii, has a less-sharply delineated dark and light grey patterning with a white ventral band, and is found around the Kerguelen Islands in the Indian Ocean..",
