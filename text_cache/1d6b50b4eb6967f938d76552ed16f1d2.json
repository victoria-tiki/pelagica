  "summary": "The giraffe seahorse is a species of fish of the family Syngnathidae. It is found in coastal waters off of the south and east coasts of Africa, from South Africa to Tanzania, and possibly north to Kenya. It lives in estuarine seagrass beds, algae beds, and shallow reefs to depths of 45 metres (148\u00a0ft), where it can grow to lengths of 10 centimetres (3.9\u00a0in). It is expected to feed on small crustaceans, similar to other seahorses.",
