  "summary": "Haplochromis argens is a species of haplochromine cichlid endemic to Lake Victoria where it is only known from the Tanzanian portion. This species reaches a length of 7.6 centimetres (3.0\u00a0in) SL. It feeds on zooplankton, primarily copepods and cladocerans, reflecting its dietary specialization as a zooplanktivore. By preying on planktonic crustaceans, it plays a key role in maintaining zooplankton population balance within the lake's ecosystem, which helps sustain its complex food web..",
