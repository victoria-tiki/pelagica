  "summary": "The American elephantfish, commonly referred to as the cockfish, belongs to the family Callorhinchidae, a unique group of cartilaginous fishes. This species has a striking appearance, characterized by a silver to gray body with prominent brown spots concentrated on the dorsal half of the fish and on the fins. Subtle hues of pink are also present around areas such as the mouth and fins. Its broad pectoral fins play a critical role in stabilization, allowing the fish to maintain balance on the ocean floor, while its heterocercal tail, a feature common among cartilaginous fishes, is highly effective for maneuvering within the water column.",
