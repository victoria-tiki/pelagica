  "summary": "The zebra shark is a species of carpet shark and the sole member of the family Stegostomatidae. It is found throughout the tropical Indo-Pacific, frequenting coral reefs and sandy flats to a depth of 62\u00a0m (200\u00a0ft). Zebra sharks are distinctive in appearance, with adults possessing five longitudinal ridges on a cylindrical body, a low caudal fin comprising nearly half the total length, and typically a pattern of dark spots on a pale background. Young zebra sharks under 50\u201390\u00a0cm (20\u201335\u00a0in) long have a completely different pattern, consisting of light vertical stripes on a brown background, and lack the ridges.",
