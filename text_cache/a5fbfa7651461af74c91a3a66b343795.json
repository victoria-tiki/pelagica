  "summary": "Arnoux's beaked whale, also called the southern four-toothed whale, southern beaked whale, New Zealand beaked whale, southern giant bottlenose whale and southern porpoise whale is one of the species of Berardius.

Little is known about their behavior due to infrequent encounters with live individuals..",
