  "summary": "The gray whale, also known as the grey whale, is a baleen whale that migrates between feeding and breeding grounds yearly. It reaches a length of 14.9 meters (49\u00a0ft), a weight of up to 41 tonnes (90,000\u00a0lb) and lives between 55 and 70 years, although one female was estimated to be 75\u201380 years of age. The common name of the whale comes from the gray patches and white mottling on its dark skin. Gray whales were once called devil fish because of their fighting behavior when hunted.",
