  "summary": "Squalus montalbani, the Philippine spurdog or Indonesian greeneye spurdog, is a relatively large species of dogfish shark native to waters off the coast of Australia, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The species was identified in 1912 from a specimen caught off the coast of Luzon Island, and has been both bycatch and a targeted species in fisheries since. Its taxonomy is complex, having been renamed in 1931, being misidentified as a type of shortspine spurdog, then being revived as a species in 2007..",
