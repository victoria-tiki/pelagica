  "summary": "The narrow-banded butterflyfish is a species of marine ray-finned fish, a butterflyfish from the family Chaetodontidae. It is found in the eastern Pacific Ocean around Easter Island, the Desventuradas Islands and the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands/ The biology of this fish is little understood but it is thought to be strongly associated with rocky reefs. The name of the person honoured in the specific name was not defined but it is considered to, almost certainly, be D.K. Cladwell's wife, the marine mammalogist Melba Caldwell of the University of Florida in Gainesville..",
