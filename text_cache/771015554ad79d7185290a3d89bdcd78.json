It is coloured golden brown, yellow-green and blueish-grey, and it grows to maximum 120 centimetres (3.9\u00a0ft). Described by Charles Walter De Vis in 1883, it is similar in appearance to other Australian wobbegongs and has previously been classified as the same species as the Gulf wobbegong. It is a nocturnal species, hunting at night, and it can bite humans when disturbed.",
