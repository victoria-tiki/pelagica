  "summary": "The great black-backed gull is the largest member of the gull family. It is a very aggressive hunter, pirate, and scavenger which breeds on the coasts and islands of the North Atlantic in northern Europe and northeastern North America. Southern populations are generally sedentary, while those breeding in the far north move farther south in winter. A few also move inland to large lakes and reservoirs.",
