  "summary": "Octopus bimaculatus, commonly referred to as Verrill's two-spot octopus, is a similar species to the California two-spot octopus, which it is often mistaken for. The two can be distinguished by the difference in the blue and black chain-like pattern of the ocelli. O. bimaculatus hunt and feed on a diverse number of benthic organisms that also reside off the coast of Southern California.",
