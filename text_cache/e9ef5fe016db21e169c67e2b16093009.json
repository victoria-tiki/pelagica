  "summary": "Hutton's shearwater is a medium-sized ocean-going seabird in the family Procellariidae. Its range is Australian and New Zealand waters, but it breeds only in mainland New Zealand. Its conservation status is Endangered, because there are just two remaining breeding colonies, located in the Seaward Kaik\u014dura Range. Six other shearwater colonies have been wiped out by introduced pigs.",
