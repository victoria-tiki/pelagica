  "summary": "The giant mudskipper is a species of mudskipper native to the tropical shores of the eastern Indian Ocean and the western Pacific Ocean where it occurs in marine, brackish and fresh waters. It is most frequently found along muddy shores in estuaries as well as in the tidal zones of rivers. It lives in burrows that it constructs in higher grounds of the intertidal zone, which are typically filled with both water and air. During warmer seasons, it is typically active outside of its burrow during low tide.",
