  "summary": "The sixgill stingray is a species of stingray and the only extant member of the family Hexatrygonidae. Although several species of sixgill stingrays have been described historically, they may represent variations in a single, widespread species. This flabby, heavy-bodied fish, described only in 1980, is unique among rays in having six pairs of gill slits rather than five. Growing up to 1.7\u00a0m (5.6\u00a0ft) long, it has a rounded pectoral fin disc and a long, triangular, and flexible snout filled with a gelatinous substance.",
